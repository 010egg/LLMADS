David Slawson of the staff of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy at 1406 hours on this date in the Commission's offices at 200 Maryland Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. The purpsse of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies in material provided the Commission by CIA and ty the Department of State which were calicd to our attention in a letter from the General Counsel of the Cummission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964. 2. By way of introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the! - Commission's report that he was writing, he sould have to deal with the : question of whett.er or not the OSWALDs! depzrture {rom the USSR - and the circumstances {i.e. timing) of that departsre - were unusual or , suspicious in any way. He expressed his belie/ that they probably were not and cited Soviet relaxation in such matters jn the post-Stalin era. However, he war.ted to be sure in his own mirg that our information was not in conflict with that which the Commission had received from State’ since all of that information would remain in the records of the Commission. 3. After stating my belief that. there was no real disagreement or inconsistency between the information from CLA and that from State, I expressed the view that the matter resolved itseif into three questiozs: Document Number 167-36 4 s De the Sovict for FOIA Review on JUN 976 . estoy. jak. os Spee ee A 13-00000 a. Dothe Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet “citizens married tu forcign nationals to emigrate from the Sovict Union to the homelands of their spouses? . b. | Do they normally permit such Soviet citizens to accompany (i.e. depart simultaneously with) their spouses from the Soviet Union? c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get Soviet exit visas ior such a purpose (time lapse from application to granting of visas)? ; : 4. Concerning the first two questions (3a and 3b above) I pointed out . _._that we had addressed ourselves mainly to the question of Soviet citizens being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while State dealt only with the larger question of Sovicts married to foreigners being atiowed to emigrate without reference to whether or not they left simultas:cously with or at another time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson cormmented that this explanation was most helpful and he reread what both we and State had said in that light. S. By way ér further explanation, I said that the statements in paragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based ona review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans. . In only four of these cases did a Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of rer foreign husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit us to categorize them. I added that although State's information began by citing the issuance of ‘724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December 1963, it did not indicate how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens who had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided detailed information for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of these whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse. /6, In response to 13-00000 4 6. In response ty a question from Mr. Slawsoa I stated that most of the'26 cases upon which we based Gur statements involved foreign ’ students, exchange teachers and other relatively transient persons, _ and while a number of cases have certain points in common, they bear ‘little similarity to the OSWALD case in that none imvolved a defector who - ‘married prior to rcpatriating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April 1964 memorandum to the Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson indicated that hg was now satisfied on this matter. 8 7. ‘Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet authorities to process exit visas for Savict citizens married to foreign nationals (question 3c above), I stated that, in my vpinion, the information provided by State (in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter) substantially corresponded to the views expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7 of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson asked if it would be pussible to elaborate paragraph 7 of our memorandum of 6 April by providing 2 statistical breakdown of the cases on which our statements were based. I indicated that this coald be done. 8. At this point Mr. Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion he felt that the question of possible inconsistencies had been resolved. However, he asked that «e send a brief written reply to the Commission's letter of 3 July 1964 embodying the substance of what I had said concerning the basis for staternentz included in our 6 April 196¢ memorandum. [This would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed to C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet visa applications. ] 9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sending parts of his report dealing with the Sovict intelligence services to CIA for checking as to their accuracy. ‘He did not say when this would occar. 10. After concluding the meeting with Mr. Slawson, I yead Volume 52 of the transcript of testimony before the Commission. s included the reinterview of Marina OSWALD. . L Lee H.

OSWALD lef - Russia for the United States wae it legal and normal under Soviet law and practice for a Rusaian national married to an American to ve able to accompany him back to his honieland?

Our reply addressed iteclf to the legality and normality of Soviet cltdizens accompa nying ies: departing simultaneously with) foreiga spouses out of the USSR. It wae baaed ona review of 26 cases, of which 16 imvolved Americans, in which foreign nationals married Soviet citizens im the USSR. In oaly four of these 26 cases, did the Soviet wife leave the Soviet Uzion in the Dot . ' company of her hueband. In one of these four cases, an Italiae Communist / Party member married 13-00000 Party member married in the USSR and by prevatling upon the Hialiea Embaasy to hold up Italfan vieas for Soviet seamen, was able to arrange for hie wife to accompany him to Italy. In two more of the cases, an American met his future wife on a vieit to the USSR, married her on'a subsequent trip, and - brought her back to the U.S. No detalis are available on the fourth case, which involved a Swedish student who married a Soviet student and apparently drought her out with him. : 3. In 14 of the remaining eases, a foreign husband (in one case a wife) i departed alone, In another case the wife preceded her huokand because he had been failed a month or two previously for violation of travel regulations and in 7 additional cases the sequence Is not known. 4.

As you know, it is our responsibility, overseas and in headquarters, to render every support possible to the Secret Service in the conduct of its statutory responsibilities in the United States, and especially when the President travels abroad. 2. The circumstances confronting the Warren Commission produced discussion and testimony on various aspects of the problem of Presidential protection and on interagency operational cooperation, which normally do not find their way into the public domain. These include the acquisition and dissemination of information, consultation, coordination, and operational interchanges, I believe you will be interested in the attached extracts of testimony given before the Warren Commission by U.S. intelligence and security officials.

Anthony, Re arding your letter 6/705 of 10 May 1982, our records indicate-that Valeriy Viadimirovich Kostikoy traveled to Mexico, France, Spain, the U.S. and Cuba during the period 1959-61. In 1961, he was assigned permanently to Mexico City as a consular officer and served there until August 1965. He was varigusly described as a translator, vice-consul, and attache. During this tour he attempted to cultivate a U.S. Government employee assigned to our embassy in Mexico City. do Rolr- - ‘ In September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald approached ‘the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR. Kostikov, as a consular officer, handled this visa request. We have no information which indicates ‘any relationship between these individuals other than for the purpose of Oswald's making his visa request. Kostikov returned to Mexico City for a second tour of duty in July 1968. During this tour he was again assigned to the consular section and was a second secretary. It appeared that he was tasked with following the activities of the Central American communist parties.and left-wing groups, and he met often with members of” these groups, reportedly providing them with funds and technical guidance. In July/August 1969, Kostikov made an unusual TDY trip to Moscow lasting three weeks. (His family remained in Mexico.) In July 1970 he made a four-day trip to Havana. Kostikov's tour in Mexico ended unexpectedly in September 1971, Our information indicated that he was not due to leave for another three to four months, and at the time of his departure, there was some speculation that the suddenness of his departure was due to the fact that = os he was known to Lyalin. too - Bo eS CROSS FILE COPY FOR 201- DO NOT DESTROY D Oso - O05 — ve> D26/- 30505 2 While in Mexico he was considered by some to be the mont effective and dangerous of intelligence officers in Mexico. He has been described as being without morals, education, and manners. | Shortly after his arrival in Mexico in 1968, he was arrested in front of a house of prostitution after becoming involved in a fist fight with some locals. It appears this incident did not affect his position in Mexico City, despite the fact that it received a good deal of press coverage. We are aware only that Kostikov arrived in Beirut in June 1978. We are unable to confirm his presence there now. Although our file indicates that Kostikev may have been a member of Department 13 (Executive Action) (Department V's predecessor), we have been unable to confirm this. Also, to the best of our knowledge the KGB has not engaged in such executive action since 1959. Sincerely, 9) /s/ David . Dayid H. Blee Mr. Anthony C. M.

We also note that EPSTEIN in "Legend" claims that accerding to a CIA telecheck KOSTIKOV was Lee Harvey OSWALD's KGB case officer in Mexico City. According to BARRON (page 335) OSWALD was in Mexico between September and November 1963 and was seeking to obtain a Soviet visa. There was certainly a KGB interest in OSWALD, although according to NOSENKO this was defensive. 3. The reason for our current interest in KOSTIKOV will be obvious. As you are aware, our Embassy in Beirut, in common with other Western Missions, has been subject » threats and violence in recent months, and in view of earlier hostile attentions from the KGB, we have been reviewing our records of KGB staff in the area who might have been involved in promoting strong-arm tactics, 4. We would be grateful for your views as to whether the KGB are likely to be behind any of the recent incidents (possibly through the Syrians) and for any information on KOSTIKOV and his activities in Mexico and in Beirut. In particular, what are your comments on the OSWALD story; can you confirm that KOSTIKOV is still in Beirut; is there anyone else in Beirut or Damascus whose . trace record suggests an Active Measures role, or worse? 5. We should be grateful for an early reply and as I said on 6 May will treat anything you can tell us on a strictly Service to Service basis.

' Staff Attorney we;DY ASSASSINATION DS ACT OF 1992 Warren Commission Report: District Attorney Garrison > REFERENCES 1. We are forwarding herewith a reprint of the article “A Reporter At Large: Garrison", published in THE NEW YORKER, 13 July, 1968. It was written by - Edward Jay Epstein, himself author of a book, ("Inquest"), critical of the Warren Commission Report. 2. The wide-spread campaign of adverse criticism of the U.S., most recently . again provoked by the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy, appears to have revived foreign interest in the assassination of his brother, the late President Kennedy, too. The forthcoming trial of Sirhan, accused of the murder of Senator Kennedy, can be expected to cause a new wave of criticism and suspicion. against. the United’ States, claiming once more the existence of a sinister "political murder conspiracy". We are sending you the attached article--based either on first-hand observation by the author or on other, identified sources=-since it deals with the continuing investigation, conducted by District Attorney Garrison : of New Orleans, La. That investigation | tends to keep alive speculations ebout the death of President Kennedy, an alleged "conspiracy", and about the possible involvement of Federal agencies, notably the FBI and CIA. . 3. The article is not meant for reprinting in any media. It is forwarded primarily for your information and for the information of all Station personnel concerned. If the Garrison investigation should be cited in your area in the context of renewed anti-U.S. attacks, you_may use the article to brief interested. contacts, especially government and other political leaders, and to demonstrate to assets (which you may assign to counter such attacks) that there is no hard -- . evidence of any such conspiracy. In this context, assets may have to explain to _ their audiences certain basic facts about the U.S. judicial system, its separation of state and federal courts and the fact that judges and district attorneys in the states are usually elected, not appointed: consequently, D.A. Garrison can continue in office as long as his constituents re-elect him. Even if your assets have to discuss this in order to refute--or at least weaken--anti-U.S. propaganda of © sufficiently serious act, any personal attacks upon Garrison (or any other- “public personality in the U.S.) must be strictly avoided. ae fet Avtochment: 1 unclassified article, -per para 1 dls Abiajan chon ACCFa Gate Addia Apaba sikia Asmrre is ALree Bungal Cacucad 2 ieftenee Georgetown Dakar Guatemala Tes ee @.

ACTION REQUESTED: PLEASE PASS TO NOC SIDNEY B. CALLICRATE PRIOR TO HIS TDY DEPARTURE TO MONTEVIDEO. 2. SUMMARY: THIS CABLE CONTAINS ASSESSMENT DATA FROM FGFORK/86 (F/86) ON SLLARCENY/1 (L/1), BASED ON F/86'S OBSERVATIONS OF, AND DISCUSSIONS WITH, L/1 AND FAMILY DURING THEIR REF OUTING TO CHUY IN EARLY JAN 94. 3. L/1 DID THE DRIVING FROM MONTEVIDEO TO CHUY. HE DOES NOT LIKE DRIVING AT NIGHT OR IN THE RAIN. IN CONTRAST WITH HIS NORMALLY PLEASANT PERSONALITY, L/1 BECOMES AGGRESSIVE AND NERVOUS BEHIND THE WHEEL. 4. WHILE FAMILIES WERE STAYING TOGETHER IN RATHER SMALL BEACH HOUSE, L/1 AND HIS WIFE GOT INTO A FIGHT. SHE APPEARED TO BE THE INSTIGATOR. F/86'S WIFE LATER TALKED TO L/1‘'S WIFE IN PRIVATE. L/1'S WIFE SAID SHE BLAMES L/1 BECAUSE WHEN L/1 ‘ DIVORCED HIS PREVIOUS WIFE, HE GAVE HER HIS APARTMENT. THUS L/1 AND HIS CURRENT WIFE WILL NOT HAVE THEIR OWN PLACE TO LIVE WHEN THEY EVENTUALLY RETURN TO CUBA. THAT IS WHY, DURING THEIR PREVIOUS TRIP TO CUBA FROM URUGUAY, L/1 AND WIFE BUILT AN EXTRA ROOM ONTO HOUSE OF MRS. L/1‘S PARENTS IN GUANABO. 5. MRS. L/1 ALSO SAID THAT L/1 IS "MUY CONSUMISTA" (I.E., A COMPULSIVE SHOPPER), AND THAT SHE HAS TO CONTROL HIM WHEN THEY GO TO THE SUPERMARKET BECAUSE L/1 ALWAYS BUYS TOO MUCH. MRS. L/1 EXPLAINED THAT L/1 GREW UP IN A VERY POOR FAMILY. THAT IS WHY HE NOW BUYS TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING. SHE ALSO SECREi' 13-00000 ‘SECRET MHFNO: 94-5394206 SENSIND: PL PAGE: 2 CRITICIZED L/1 FOR SPOILING THEIR CHILDREN (HIS OLDER DAUGHTER BY PREVIOUS MARRIAGE AND THEIR YOUNGER DAUGHTER), BY GIVING THEM WHATEVER THEY ASK FOR. MRS. L/1 HAS A POOR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OLDER DAUGHTER. SHE ADDED THAT L/1'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS TWO GROWN SONS IS GOOD BUT SOMEWHAT DISTANT. 6. F/86 PERSONALLY OBSERVED L/1'S COMPULSIVE SHOPPING WHEN THEY ALL WENT TO CHUY ON 8 JAN. BOTH L/1 AND HIS WIFE BOUGHT LARGE NUMBER OF ITEMS TO SEND TO THEIR FAMILY IN CUBA. AT ONE POINT, L/1 TOLD HIS WIFE. THAT HE WOULD DO THE BUYING AND SHE SHOULD BE THE HOUSEWIFE. MRS. L/1 CALLED HIM A "DUMB SPANIARD" ("GALLEGO BRUTO"). F/86 SUSPECTS THAT L/1 AND WIFE HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS, POSSIBLY DUE TO L/1‘'S INFIDELITY. DURING THEIR SPATS, MRS. L/1 WAS USUALLY THE AGGRESSOR, WITH L/1 TRYING TO KEEP PEACE OR SIMPLY REMAINING QUIET. MRS..L/1 ALSO GOT INTO ARGUMENTS WITH SOME OF THE PALESTINIAN MERCHANTS IN CHUY. 7. ONE OTHER ASPECT OF L/1'S FAMILY WHICH F/86 FOUND DISAGREEABLE WAS BEHAVIOR OF L/1'S OLDER DAUGHTER. F/86 AND HIS WIFE WERE BOTH OFFENDED BY DAUGHTER'S FREQUENT SEXUAL REFERENCES IN FRONT OF F/86'S YOUNGER CHILDREN. F/86 SAID THAT L/1’S DAUGHTER ACTED JUST LIKE A CUBAN HOOKER. 8. ON A MORE ELEVATED PLANE, F/86 ALSO HAD SOME PRIVATE PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS WITH L/1. IN RESPONSE TO F/86‘S DIRECT QUESTION, L/1 SAID THAT THE WRITERS WHO HAVE INFLUENCED HIM THE MOST ARE MARX, HEGEL AND KANT. L/1 SAID THAT LENIN’S MAIN ACHIEVEMENT WAS TO RECOGNIZE NEED FOR ONLY ONE PARTY. L/1 CONSIDERS LENIN TO HAVE BEEN AN INTEPRETER OF MARX BUT NOT A GREAT THEORETICIAN. TO SOME EXTENT, L/1 DEFENDED LENIN'S SO-CALLED “LAW OF ECONOMIC PRUDENCE", A MEANS OF ECONOMIC PLANNING WHICH LENIN UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPTED TO IMPLEMENT IN USSR. AFTER LENIN’S DEATH, IT BECAME EXCESSIVELY BUREAUCRATIZED AND ATROPHIED, ALTHOUGH THIS SYSTEM DID WORK WITH SOME SUCCESS IN BULGARIA. 9. L/1 ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED NEED FOR "NEOLIBERAL MEDICINE" TO REFORM CUBAN ECONOMY, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER SOLUTION. L/1 ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT REFORMS SHOULD BE INSTITUTED WITH MINIMUM SOCIAL AND POLITICAL COSTS. WHILE STATE SHOULD NOT BE EXCESSIVELY INTERVENTIONIST IN ECONOMY, L/1 WANTS STATE TO RETAIN ITS PROTECTIVE SOCIAL ROLE, BECAUSE MARKET ECONOMY ALSO HAS ITS FAULTS. ‘ 10. L/1 TALKED ABOUT ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY. ACCORDING TO L/1, IN 1969, L/1 PERSONALLY SAW FIDEL CASTRO RECEIVE A GROUP OF U.S. RADICALS. CASTRO TALKED TO THEM FOR TWO HOURS ABOUT WHY JUST ONE ASSASSIN COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE KILLED KENNEDY. CASTRO ORDERED A REENACTMENT OF THE CRIME, USING HIS BEST MARKSMEN, AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE *WHAT<LEE HARVEY OSWALD>SUPPOSEDLY DID BY HIMSELF. L/1 SAID THAT THREE GROUPS WERE INVOLVED IN KILLING THE PRESIDENT: ONE GROUP OF CUBANS, ONE GROUP O "MAFIOSOS" AND A THIRD GROUP OF MERCENARIES. THE THIRD GROUP INCLUDED A MAN WITH A GREEK NAME. L/1 TOLD F/86 THAT IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER ANY OF THESE . SECRET 13-00000 SECRET MHFNO: 94-5394206 SENSIND: PL PAGE: 3 GROUPS EVER HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH PNINFINITE. IN THIS REGARD, F/86 REPORTED TO STATION THAT L/1 IS ALWAYS CAREFUL NOT TO ATTACK PNINFINITE WHEN F/86 IS PRESENT. 11. STATION REPORTING ADDITIONAL INFO FROM F/86 SEPARATELY. 12. FILE: 201-1454795.

The system also provides a means for identifying subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela- tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi- zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre- spondence has accumulated. 2. THE 201 SYSTEM The principal features of the 201 system are: . a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that _ individual. ._b, The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form =>: =- " 831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, ie, per- °-- oO sonal history, current status, aud prospects. ooo ew : The ‘Master 20r Record: a “machine ‘yebord Ginetaied by: the opening oF a 201 file.

Ol Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 ‘per- sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli- gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OF codes for use by components: (1) general ol codes (Attachment 4) (2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services or other specific organizations. A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem- orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management Officer. A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned ‘when the 20] Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added at a later date by a Form 831 amendment. The 20] system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201 personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members of that service. . f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers exist. - 3. OPENING A 20] DOSSIER a. General -The opening of a 201. dossier is the prerogative: of an operational ‘com-* ‘ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing. . of 4 201 dossier,are controlled jointly by the desks and.ISG. 201 dossiers may be = van “ opened on persons who meet the carding critéria described in Chapter If of this ”- handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on { : persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per- sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those} persons for whom provisional operational. approvals and operational approvals‘. are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff A employees, staff agents and most categorfes of contract employees.

These’ are listed in Attachment 2. 201 dossiers should be opened in the following categories: wwe (1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap- proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera- tional interest for training purposes only. (2) Person for whom the field requests a 201 opening. (3) [Sear oxruRg] personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel. - _@) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part 1 - (8) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals information ‘in five ° or more documents (see DOI 70-20). ; (6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/ ISR (opened only by IP/RMS). b. Requesting a 201 File Opening Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling ont and submitting a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main- tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the - master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the’ assign- ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality, Attachment 3 consists .of sample 201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's.

When additional information is discovered on a 201 subject through a name trace or other process, i.e. review of predecessor documents, it must be consolidated into his personality dossier.

Record documents may range from newspaper or magazine articlés on the subject to finance and other administrative papers, . 14-00000 SECRET DOHB 70-1-1 CHAPTER III, ANNEX B 15 November 1974 a. Purging a. Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following: . ‘ (1) Duplicate material, i.c., exact copy(s) of a document. (2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for the opening. (3) All abstract slips, (4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884). (5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report. (6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments. (7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is by the Records Officer. (8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in-a 201 dossier forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention | in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret. classification '- authority. If the document canriot be downgraded the file should be retained’ at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be removed,. retained a in a desk TS file or forwarded to ‘the Top Secret Control Officer, and ‘a: _ cross-reference sheet’ (Form sary placed in the’ "2a file le giving ‘the location of the TS ‘dceument? --- oo (9) Deferred documents (se0 5b(2)). b.

(3) Field index cards (hela by some- desks) and area desk cards may - be retained in the 201 as part of a consolidation procedure. These cards should be mounted on a full-size sheet of paper for filing in the 201. .
