Referent B forwards an analysis of possible Agency involvement with suspected criminal elements in the Bahamas. Referent A is a commentary on this analysis that details CCS relationships with individuals associated with a company that is reputed to be an employer of organized crime figures. No specific fact is presented that would legally raise the suspicion of the commission of a violation of law, morality or ethics by the U.S. citizen businessmen now cooperating with this Agency: Major General : William P. Fisher (USAF-Ret.); Mr. John P. Roulett (USN-Ret.); and ” “Mr v Albert Whisnant. : 2. In the sensitivity of this time, it would be imprudent not to - recognize that mere proximity to unsavory elements is sufficient for some to suggest guilt by association. This Agency recognizing that. unfortunate _ fact of life has an obligation to protect the rights of those upon whom we have prevailed to cooperate. The only direct method immediately, apparent is to sever our relationship with voiced gratitude for past servidés in the national interest. The timing proposed by C/CCS in referent A appears ' appropriate. . 3. It should be noted that General Fisher's son isa DDO case officer] That fact dictates that every effort be made. to contain the Substance of this. and referent memoranda to the narrowest possible audience to preclude unwarranted acrimony and suspicion until proof positive of eviljor criminal activity is certain, which event is extremely doubtful.

After considering the matter a ength, it was ascertained that the Agency has a cleared (emp. lyment) service in (0 Pittsburgh) which could possibly be utilized as an initial q assessment. This firm, the EMPLOYNENT SERVICE COMPANY, ? is located in the Union Trust Buildi , Pittsburgh, Pennsyivania,) fo and is managed by(argaret A. x LRIET) (see SSD File 95018).

Information contained in Subject's file is of a miscellaneous nature. He has had no Agency affiliation or use. 2, An FBI reply dated 19 October 1966 to an inquiry from this Agency stated that FBI files contained references to Subject's assignment in Moscow as a correspondent for Newsweek but did not contain any information of a derogatory nature concerning KORENGOLD. 3, Extract of Foreign Service Dispatch No, 392 from Amembassy Moscow to the Department of State, Washington, D.C. dated 12 December 1960 listed Robert KORENGOLD as UPI correspondent in Moscow. No remarks were made concerning KORENGOLD. 4. An Overseas Press Bulletin dated 24 April 1965 reported that Newsweek's bureau chief, Robert KORENGOLD, gave a cocktail party for visiting Newsweek's foreign editor, Robert CHRISTOPHER. 5. On page 4 of a Department of State report of investigation dated 14 December 1965 regarding the activities of a Department of State employee in Moscow, William Henry LUERS, LUERS said that Robert KORENGOLD, Newsweek correspondent, was interested in interviewing a Soviet painter whose work had been shown in Paris. The report further stated "At KORENGOLD's request, LUERS 14-0000" | attempted to arrange for such a meeting through Andre AMALRIK. After calling from the Embassy to arrange the appointment, LUERS and KORENGOLD went to AMALRIK's apartment. The painter was not there, and shortly after their arrival two militia men and KGB officers came to AMALRIK's apartment. AMALRIK was arrested, tried, and sentenced for being a 'parasite'. LUERS said that his superior at the Embassy, Malcolm TOON, was unhappy about this activity and was critical of LUERS in his efficiency rating because of it. LUERS said he did not previously mention it to the interviewing agent because he did not wish to further complicate matters." (LUERS was security approved as a GS-7 JOT in June 1957, subject to technical interview, but his case was cancelled when he accepted another position. He was subsequently granted liaison clearances in February and March 1962.) . 6.
