H : the United States and returned legally to Cuba(in March 1961 to serve as yy : resident agent in.Havana.> Since then he has built a net @f over twenty fly sub-agents and“*has*sent back 140 S/W messages, from which upwards of - fifty intelligence disseminations have been made. He is highly : ‘. motivated for his work and under effective control by JMWAVE. The quality of his production is, for-the most part, very good and improving although‘he is at times distracted by an understandable interest in para-military operations. Operationally he is very skillful; however, . he has been known to. take unnecessary risks. There is no reason to think that he is under hostile control nor that the operation is likely’ in the future to be turned against us. There De however, the real. we risk that he may one day fa}1 into a G-2 trap baited with the Escambray guerrillas. If so, this Will be due to the fact that contact with the guerrill was his first assignment and, although he has been re- : directed "to intelligence collection, he sometimes seems to feel that e has led in his primary mission. This, plus the fact that he a evident. believes that the end is now very close, is apt to make him. f. 1 -ertseneg to an appeal from the “heroes of the mi Py - : AN @Present Status of the 0 eration. - Modus 0 erandi: S$.

If he approves of a person, he will recruit him. “However, he has shown himself to be very cautious in granting his approval. He has reported two persons whom he does not. -. completely trust because, while otherwise well qualified, they drink. too much and are indiscreet. For two other examples, AMBOAel and LITAUe& approached him separately and revealed their relationship with identical. with reserve while he checked them out with JMWAVE. He has submitted, the names of other contacts for checking. In the case of AMFAUNA-4, ( it, he put his misgivings in-writing: "Right away AMFAUNA-1 arranged for a personal interview, taking utmost precautions» since we have had sad previous experiences with members of CASTRO's armed forces." 8.. Once he has recruited a sub-agent, AMFAUNA=1 manages to keep i an independent eye on the former's security. On more than one occasion and that for the time being he is staying away from him. _ 9. In general AMFAUNA-1 seems to trust in the efficiency of his security precautions. On 25 February 1962 he reported that Identity 1 had been caught, but that he was in no danger because he had been compartmented from her.°Thisycomp. etmentati is achieved by the use -*} of (five, cutouts: "AMA? OM FAUNA-3, ANFAGN Ba AMBOA-1, and A=5, who maintain contact for AMFAUNA-1 with most if not all of his subeagents. Chart A, which shows AMFAUNA-1 in. direct contact with AMFAUNAS 7: through 13, may be in error on this point. It would be more in keeping with AMFAUNA-1's known modus operandi for him to have . cutouts between himself and these sub-agents, ‘If there is a cutout or cutouts here, their identity is not yet knéwn, There may also be an 10.

His méssages to JMWAVE are sent to accommodation addresses serviced by AMPAN-2 and AMCUTLER-1, JMWAVE's,messages to him are addressed to AMFAUNA-14.

Lo: d. AMBOQA+1: The origin of AMFAUNA-l's contact with this agent, who has also been recruited independently by . JMWAVE, is uncertain. He first mentioned her in October 6 1961 as his cutout to Identity-14,(a Cubana Airlines pilot) who had formerly been a contact of ‘AMCUSP-1 and who subsequent- ly defected. AMFAUNA-1's last mention of her was on 15 . November when he reported that she had given him a map show- ing artillery installations on the south coast of Las Villas. It is possible that AMFAUNA-1 has broken contact with her, but since he has not reported having done so it is considered a _more likely that she remains hie cutout to(two Cubana Airlines? pilote}who are known to be still reporting * , (1) AMFAUNA-18: He was recruited in March 1962, and has provided AMFAUNA-1 with(passenger lists) 24 and the\location of artillery emplacements) which he has (spotted from his aircraft). it is rot tknown how AMFAUNA-1 first met AMFAUNA-18, and it is possible that AMFAUNA-1 meets directly with him. | It is only surmised that AMBOA-1l, is his cutout to | | him. (2) AMFAUNA-19: He was recruited at the same time aS AMFAUNA-18. Althcugh AMFAUNA-1 did not explicitly say so, it can be inferred that he and AMFAUNA-18 are witting of each other's recruitment.

The JMWAVE case officer who trained AMFAUNA-1 in tradecraft in“March 1961 (see UFGA-1247 of 10 TApril 1961) observed that he already had a grounding in clandestine hniques. The case officer also characterized AMFAUNA-l as "a pheasant, intelligent fellow" and "the most astute member of the team" comprising himself, AMCUS@yl) and AMCUTLER-1 4 vey A ol” & i i EE AAT U8 ARREST ATE EINE COATES ATO BAE th HE PARA STE ITE ORO APEHAUAE C20 KEPROOUCTION 14-00000 GLACSIPIGATION °° f yp . “, .t ; ; & f SECRET - en — ST eT CONTINUATION GF UFGK-470 | BISPATCH oO ; children, all atill in Cubaf{as of ugcon 1961) However, it ie noted that the two children havea different matronymics, that neither of them is his wife's last name, and that all three dependents have different addresses. It is ascumed that this is his third wife. Since AMFAUNA-1 has never mentioned her in any of his S/W correspondence, it is also assumed that she has gone the way of her tyo predecessors. ‘fre cS) we 18, AMCUTLER-1. who was questioned on this point, said that his 4 “Brother is living in(Guanabacoa) with his present wife, that he has been ‘ci ocmarried only once beforej°and has only one child from the first marriage 4 is information is not considered definitive, because the last point ih directly contradicted by AMFAUNA-1's PRQ Part I which he wrote him- if, but it is included here for what it aay be worth.

The elements of AMFAUNA--1's motivation, then, include an adventurous spirit and a taste for clandestine work.

His connection with KUBARK provides him with the means to do this work. This is believed to be a strong element of control. There have heen many opportunities to test this control, by ordering AMFAUNA-1 te do something or to desist from doing something else, and the control is believed to be effective.

All three are known to AMFAUNA-5, and it is believed that sh. is nrobably the cutout to them, 85, Identity-55 and Identity-56 were mentioned briefly as active during the period from December 1961 to Ap:i1 1962. The former had been a contact of AMRUNG- pl and seems to have gone into hiding; in any case, nothing more has been reported on him. The latter was an agent of AMFAUNA-1 in (Santiago de Cubajoin January 1962 he was in niding and awaiting a chancé to go into asylum. 46.

Production: 48, JMWAVE records do not show thé tocal number of AMFAUNA reports disseminated since January 1561. The figure is at least fifty, and is believed to be nearer cone hunired, if the present frequency. of dissemination can be a criterion. I: content they have leaned , heavily toward the activities of insurgent groups, militia movemants, location of artillery, and aviation matters. There has been a more recent tendency toward political and economic information, which is being encouraged by JMWAVE, Evaluations of his production are lacking. 49, The possibility that AMFAUNA-1 is a double agent is censider- ed remote. His successful LCFLUTTER, the fact (or what is believed to be the fact) that his close friend and fellow agent cusP-i) was executed, and AMFAUNA-l's owi character and background, alljargue against the proposition that he was originally dispatched by the G-2. However, it must be admitted that the LCFLUTTER caribe beaten.; Also that there is no proof, other. than the fact that AMCU poh uize is in the JMWAVE area and behaving like a widow, that ANCUSP-1)was really executed. There is documentary evidence plin the formolof a letter written by a fellow prisoner to AMCUSP-1's) widow, that he was held in prison in March and April 1961.

Similarly, all that is known about AMFAUNA-1's background comes from AMFAUNA-1's own statemants embodied in his PRQ Part I, No. confirmation of this information has aver been obtained. From this point of view there is no guarantee that AMFAUNA-1 ie what he claims to be. For all the proof to the contrary available to JMWAVE, he could as easily have been al Spanish) Communist as a member of the (Spanish Falanges 24 q : $1. These points are listed for the sake of ccmpletenggao, but © little@limportance is attached to them. Tht known fact that (QUANTUM=82 and (QUANTUM-52 consider AMFAUNA-1 reliable suggests that he at least was not a(Spanish)Communist. And an unusually extensive independent view has''been obtained of. AMFAUNA-1's operations through the reports and debriefings of eight of his egents who have either escaped to or are in communication with the United States. The defection I: Identity-14, and the escape and debriefing» of Identity-19, Faontity-23, Identity-26, and Identity-29, have all cor.tirmed parte of AMFAUNA=1'8 |, story. Finally, AMCOG-3 has reported by &,/W that AMCOG-2 is in contact - with AMFAUNA-1, and AMFAUNA-2's telephone conversations with AMCUTLER-1} provide a continuing check on the safety ¢ud whereabouts of AMFAUNA-1.9/ 52. For the same reasons, the possibility is heavily discounted that AMFAUNA-1 has been caught and doubled by the G-2 since his arrival in Cuba, Additional indications that all is still well are the fact that he never omits the safety signal that was given him for use in his S/W, that his operational activities are consistent with his character and background, and that the reporting of his agents is consistent with thejr access to information. 53. Whether AMFAUNA-1 is now in danger of being detected, and whether the G-2 could double him if they do catch him, are two questions remaining to be considered. Taking the second question first, it is believed that the chances of the G-2 running a successful CI operation against KUBARK through AMFAUNA-1 are extremely slim. To be sure, the G-2 has certain weapons that¢they could use against AMPAUNA-1. | His father is already lin prison, serving a fifteen-year sentence, and his mother and two children(are atill in Cuba ac potential hostages.) It is also conceivable that the G-2 could use AMFAUNA-1's own interest in paramilitary operations as a lever by persuading him that KUBARK, by neglecting to support the insurgent leader Oswaldo RAMIREZ, was responsible for the latter's death and has demonstrated its indifference to the fate of the Cuban people. This would all take time, however, because AMFAUNA-1's reaction to arrest, at Least initially, would of, probably be an attempt tojgmulate his two heroes, AMCUSP-1) and AMRUNG-D. In the time that it woul@/take the G-2 to break dowm\this resistance, At UTLER-1) would almosttéertainly have learned, either through his phone‘leonversations with AMFAUNA-2 0: ‘by the interruption of the same, «hat something is wrong with AMFAUNA-1. “ ; ' $4, The risks that AMFAUNA-1 is now running are believed to be considerable. for one thing, at least ten persons with varying degrees of knowledge of his clandeetine operations, have been held temporarily or permanently by the G-Z, which is believed to be increasing in competence as a security force. For another, AMFAUNA-1 takes unnecessar chances, as by interrogating a new and untested agent (AMFAUNA-4) in the personal automobile of his sister-in-law, or by personally trying to penetrate a restricted area. And for a third, he has some contacts which can be dangerous.to him. 55. AMCOG-2 knows too much about AMFAUNA-1 for the latter's good. It is believed that AMFAUNA-1 himself is aware that this is a potential- ly serious security weakness, because he ‘took the trouble to report it (see paragraph 15al above). TMe AMCOG operation is itself a fairly complex one, and will be analyzed in a separate dispatch. The, aspects of it which, bear,on the AMFAUNA operation are that AMCOG-2 and(her o c brother AMéoc-3 dre (close relatives of a very prominent anti-Communistod Cuban politician) and that they are widely known, both in Cuba and in eerie PRODUOTIONS 14-00000 HO, |b — : . 2 Sen UFGA-4703 et CONTINUATION OF | BISPATCH prosecution for actspagainst it, is a matter for wonder. It has been rumorad that (the old°politician\has a blackmail hold over Fidel CASTRO by virtue of ‘ie possession of very damaging information about CASTRO. There may be some substance to this rumor. As a young student estes is believed to have committed criminal acts, and the (old politician would have been in the best possible position at the time to obtain proof of them. This might well explain why the family enjove immunity today. 56. It would seem, though, that an aler* and competent security service, which the G-2 shows signs of becominy, if it 18 enjoined from arresting and prosecuting an espionage suspect, would at least try to control and moniter his operations by penctrating them. It is there- fore a cause for speculation that, in February 1962, an important officer of the Cuban Army CAMEAUNA-4 4 allegedly desirous of defecting, was introduced by Identity-13 to AMCOG-2, and a matter for Jeep concern that AMCOG-2 passed the lead along to AMFAUNA-1 who accepted it with- out any prior checking and actually held his first meeting with the would-be defector in an automobile tracea"le to AMFAUNA-2. Since then, it has been observed that reports avd sub-sources offared by AMFAUNA-4 are absorbing an increasing amount of AMFAUNA-1's time. The military manuals andjcocuments turned over by AMFAUNA-4, and sent ‘to Headquarters via the (QUANTUM and the (adrid, Station have not yet been geen by JMWAVE, so it is not ‘yet known whether AMFAUNA-4's production ean be given a sufficiently high evaluation to allay the doubts raised by the manner of his recruitment. Headquarters is asked to advise on this as soon as pogsible, and to provide traces on AMFAUNA-4, comet 57. The other potentially dangerous contacts are, as might be expected, in the field of para--military activities. In November 1961 & AMFAUNA-1 was in touch with Identity-52, a(nephew of Oswaldo RAMIREZ, through Identity-51, a resident of (Cienfuegos to Identity-52 was arrested) late in the year 24 AMFAUNA=1 then developed another contact to the(Gswaldo RAMIREZ group) through Identity-12, (RAMIREZ's Havana ) representative, whose cutout to AMFAUNA-1. was AMFAUNA-=2, a woman from Sancti Spiritus)now resident in Havana, Identity-12 was arrested in jpn presumably as an aftermath of the 16 April battle in, which AMIREZ was reportedly killed. 58. in late May or early June 1967, fdentity-8, a person from Sancti, Spiritus known to AMFAUNA-3, called om her in the company of a certain Ricardo *r2QuTERDE) o claimed tcfpave had a meeting on 28 May near Tceinidad with one Comandante Fide: *HERNANDEZ Perez who gave TZQUIERDO) a letter for delivery to Identity, iz.

It is difficult if not impossible to give an operation of this complexity the support and direction it needs, when the only communication with theMrincipal agent is by secret writing. There is never@tenough room in an S/W message for both the positive intelligen reporting and the supporting operational detaile, and it is the lattar that suffer.

SEALE is on a visit to Scandanavia to express his views about the struggle between tne races in the United States. The Norwegian "Black Panther" Committee and Red Front arranged the visit. Nothing has improved conditions for Black America under former President Johnson ané President Nixon's proposal to introduce "Black Capitalism" in the ghettoes will only increase feelings of black racial hate xrted SEALE, who emphasized that the "Black Panthers" are not sesking their own sevarate society. Tre races have Lived gene rately for 200 years and now it is time to go forward, said the very eloquent BOBBY SBaL&, His manner of expression was judicious and po clished, aside from repeated references to the "Police Force* in the US, which he calls "pigs". 14-00000 - ot - lo Q Toe “Black Pantser* Party became known for tne first time WaTR SLE and one of the Party leaders, EY P.

During the reporting period the LIANCHOR leftist writer press service produced 35 individual articles and serialized political feature articles which were distributed to 20 newspapers throughout Latin America and are known to have been published regularly by at. least 12 newspapers.

The U.S. $4,000 was to be paid by, LINLUCK to WOFIRM as partial reimbursement of the costs of “pub— lishing the JMROD book. During the visit to Guatemala, o\(LINLUCK) was told by ARRIAGA and other Guatemalan . government officials that he could expect a consular appointment by the summer of 1963. b. Headquarters and the Mexico Station were agreed that as soon as he could organize LIANCHOR and find a suitable replacement” (LINLUCK should be terminated and leave Mexico. Following the’receipt of the LIANCHOR project approval in early 1968, the LIANCHOR case officer told, (LINLUCK) that he was expected to find a replacement neeting WOFIRM approval and be ready to turn the opera- tion over to his replacement by the end of March, 1968. ol(LINLUCK) proposed Identity-4, who had shown the most interest in the LIANCHOR press service and had been the first to submit articles. By accident the case officer was forced to. listen to an hour's conversation between ° Identity-4 and@INLUCK after Identity-4 came to (LINLUCK's home, interrupted a meeting between the case officer and Ol GLINLUCK) and the case officer sat trapped in a separate room ubbeknownst to Identity-4. From the conversation the case officer observed that Identity-4 was actually a political rightist, believed (ZINLUCK to be an LNHARP agent, had grandiose plans by using’ LNHARP funds to mushroom LIANCHOR into a continent-wide anti-Communist’ movement and was married to a neurotic woman who had hired a private detective agency to check on her husband's activities\)| (LINLUC was instructed to quietly ease Identity-4 out of LIANCHOR, to cease holding group meet- ings of LIANCHOR writers and to try to prevent further contact between Identity-4 and other members of LIANCEOR. c.d|Identity-5 was selected as the next candidate to replace (LINLUCK)as P/A. Identity-5 was technically, linguistically,’ intellectually and professionally well qualified to head LIANCHOR. During the period of develop- ment and assessment of Identity-4 by LINLUCR,cIrdentity-5 wrote an excellent article on Soviet intelléctual piracy. However, Identity-5 proved difficult to contact and control and turned out to be leading a personal life which would have detracted seriously from his ability to administer LIANCHOR 0( LINLUCK) was told to keep in - touch with Identity-5, but to look for still another candidate. d. In early April ARRIAGA sque’ was exiled to Miami. With the Station's concurrence (LINLUCK)\went to Guatemala during Easter to confer with Guatemalan President, Julio MENDEZ Montenegro, and the new Defense Minister concern- ing his own future .4} The President said he had not forgotten LINLUGK) but would not-be able to give him a consular post until the outset of 1969.

Ganev) Involvement in Covert Action Operations Targetted Against Soviet Poe evgen arch-Apr : re} a. In March (LINLUCK) drafted an open letter to Soviet poet Yevgenyi YEVTUSHENKO asking the Russian to use his influence to persuade the Soviet government to-end the persecution of Soviet intellectuals, artists, writers and . poeta .o| (LINLUCK, managed to obtain the signatures of stu- dents, professors, actors, dancers, writers and intellec- tuals for his open letter and then persuaded the publisher of his books to print thousands of copies, which were distributed by other assets of the Mexico Station. A copy -of the open letter was published in "EXCELSIOR" on the day of YEVTUSHENKO's arrival in Mexico for what was originally billed as a personal trip. Because of the open letter and critical press coverage of YEVTUSHENKO 's rude behavior towards the press on arriving at Mexico City airport, the Russian Ewbassy called a special press conference the evening of the day of the poet's arrival. At the press conference YEVTUSHENKO spoke with outrage of the open letter, carefully dodging a number of questions asked by the letter, and chided the signers of the letter for claiming there was absolute literary freedom in Mexico, asking how there can be freedom anywhere in the world as long as there is no freedom in Vietnam. YEVTUSHENKO's remarks about the open letter left no doubt that he had come to Mexico as a-Soviet propagandist and not as a rebel poet, ; ol . b, Cimvuck) also produced a handbill quoting the telegram by Soviet intellectuals to the "Consultative “Conference of Communist Parties" at Budapest, asking for an end to Soviet persecution of intellectuals in the USSR. The handbill featured two pen and ink drawings of imprisoned Soviet poets Sinyavsky and Daniel.

MICHELENA published a series of professional criticisms of YEVTUSHENKO as a poor® , poet and opportunist in the Mexican press. In April, . immediately following YEVTUSHENKON's departure, & Con- densation of the MICHELENA critiques of YEVTUSHENKO were published in the leftist political illustrated magazine "IMPACTO" by LILISP-E. d. Identities 3 and 6 of the LIANCHKOR group also published articles against YEVTUSHENKO in the rightist daily “EL SOL", but the Station felt the articles were too vitriolic and unobjective to be a credit to LIANCHOR. In fact, because of these articles the Station plans to remove both Identities 3 ana 7 from LIANCHOR; for it is obvious that both persons have long since lost all traces of their former leftism and are extreme rightists. EFFECTIVENESS : 2 , ) . 8. Views on LIANCHOR Effectiveness by Owner/Director of Guatemala Daily "EL IMPARCIAL™: fo) a. During (LINLUCK’s) Easter visit to Guatemala City — he was told by the owner of "EL IMPARCIAL" that the 9] newspaper was only interested in publishing @INLUCK's articles. The newspaper owner stated that (L NLUCK was a well-known personality in Guatemala and also wro interestingly. The owner also said that he had pub- lished one series by Identity-4 because Identity-4 was a Guatemalan who at one time had been important. However, the owner pointed out that the other LIANCEOR writers were unknowns and did not write well. He singled out Identity-3 as being a "menace to journalism" because much of what she wrote amounted to libel or slander. b. The "EL IMPARCIAL” owner said that he received the newspapers "EL DIA" of Honduras, "LA PRENSA GRAFICA" of El Salvador, "LA PRENSA" of Nicaragua, "LA REPUBLICA" . of Costa Rica, "LA ESTRELLA" of Panama and "ULTIMAS NOTICIAS" of Caracas and had noted that these newspapers. all published, INLUCK 's) articles but had not, to his knowledge, pub ished articles by any of the other LIANCHOR writers, 2 - ’ 0 c. When (LINLUCK) explained the coo reorativel nature of “LIANCHOR, the "BL IMPARCIAL" man told (LINLUCK) that he ° could never hope to collect fees for His news service . until the service became both famous and sought after. The "EL IMPARCIAL" owner advised (LINLUCK) to find writers tter known in Latin America. °'He suggested that if ol LINLUCK) could not afford to pay his writers fees, he should”’persuade first class writers to contribute to LIANCHOR purely for the prestige of having their material . publighed araund Latin America, a o - : 9.

Of nine persons who belonged to the group as of 15 January, three subsequently dropped out because of differences of opinion which developed at group meet- ings. In addition? (INLUCK) learaed that persons he had selected partly because of their leftist records (Iden- tities 3, 4, 7 and 8) had:long since ceased being leftists and were prone to submit manuscripts with texts politically harmful to the image of LIANCHOR. Confused political thinking and poor writing resulted in re ection of over 20 manuscripts during February-April by LL INLUCK! and the case officer. Rejection of manuscriptslin turn angered and insulted some of the writers. b. The personalities and chmracter,,of some of the writers have presented problems to (LINL' CK in directing and developing the LIANCHOR group into,a productive unit. Identities 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 had jo be goaded continually by ILINLUCK)to turn in manuscripts on assigned themes. BothgIdent ty-3 and Identity-7 turned out to be emotional extremists, suffering at times from deep melancholy and at other times from inexplainable rages which were re- flected in their writings. As of this writing the Station feels that the only reliable members of the group are Identities 6 and 9, who should be kept as members of the group as long as LIANCHOR is run as a group cooperative press service. The unreliable but brilliant and versatile poet/writer/lexicographer Identity=5 should be continued as a contact of LIANCHOR for occasional emergency use provided(LINLUCK' replacement can obtain any cooperation from Identity-5.°| In summary the LIANCHOR group composed of Identities 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 has proved ineffective and. not too productive and the ineffective members should be replaced. of 10. Effectiveness of p/a (LinLucr; . La) a. The list of articles and features by CINnLuCKS under Separate Cover Attachment "B" is by no means the measure of the agent's writing and production capability. After the. agent dusted off and mailed out several of his _old article series in December 1968 the case officer instructed,(LINLUCK) to reduce his production in ratio to the manusétipts of other LIANCHOR writers which were mailed out. The case officer was concerned that LIANCHOR would eho tolls wveK's)1 client newspapers to be primarily a vehicle for(LINLUCK's)lengthy political essays in con- trast to the statement in the LIANCHOR prospectus that LIANCHOR was a press service combining articles on cultural, educational, economic and social as well as political topics by many writers. During the agent's two final months of , service he has been given authorization to write as much ‘ as he can on the Vietnam issue and other topics for the purpose of building up his name in Guatemala before he returns there to enter politics. j vo ene REPHODUCTIO b. While production of articles was not (LinLucK's\ weak point, his selection and handling of the LIANCHOR e press service writers appears to have been weak. He has been too long on the fringes of the foreign exile group in Mexico and his contacts among leftists in Mexico are - no longer significant. In addition, the agent appears to” have gone the way of many former Latin American Communists. in that his theoretical solution to some of the political, economic and social problems of Latin America can no longer be termed leftist. ‘ vy A Arabi gy a . 0000 out NUATION OF . £ o| (LINLUCK's co-workers apparently were ineffective to the point oisearch _ gp gpcRET -- | HMMA-34792 — .. . of - ¢..

However, because no © newspaper felt like paying fees to LIANCHOR or answering LINLUCK 's correspondence, it has not been possible to ascertain whether LIANCHOR articles have been published with any regularity in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia or Ecuador, It is too much to ask third country stations to scan the press daily for articles by seven different people.

If Identity-l rejects recruitment, the next candi- date for LIANCHOR chief is Identity-10, who has already told (Lin.uck)that he is prepared to take over LIANCHOR on a pro o|\.ionary. basis to see whether it will enhance his reputatio., The Station feels that Identity-10 would be “ easier to recruit than Identity-1, However, Identity-10 is not too well known in Mexico and is totally unknown abroad. One of Identity-10's virtues is the fact that he never formally quit the Communist Party and has done nothing to irritate the Party. As economic and general reporter for "EXCELSIOR" he offers placement potential. If Identity-1 ‘- does accept recruitment, the Station still intends to try to recruit Identity-10 as a singleton under Project LIANCHOR, possibly steering Identity-10 to Identity-1 and the LIANCHOR press service after due consideration. The Station is also interested in the possibility of recruiting Identity-10 in order to send him to the World Youth Festival at. Sofia, . since it is believed by!(LINLUCK) that Identity-1 still has access to some worthwhile contacts in Central. American young Communist circles. a 16, Testing for Indications of Effectiveness to Determine Future Direction of LYANCHOR Project: a. It is estimated that it will not cost over U.S. $200 to hire clipping services in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Santiago and Bogota for a three month trial period to test whether newspapers which receive LIANCHOR material in those cities are publishing the LIANCHOR material, The clipping services will be asked to watch for articles with the LIANCHOR by-line, the by-lines of LIANCHOR writers and the headlines or titles which are assigned by LIANCHOR to the articles mailed to the newspapers. : aPC RAR SMEAR PME b, If the clipping service tests show that newspapers or periodicals in two of the above cited countries are publishing LIANCHOR material, Station will continue to. pursue the development of a small and responsive leftist writer group ag one phase of the LIANCHOR operation. The rationale behind this decision is that there is little justification in operating a press service, even a cheap one, with a readership limited to Mexico, Central America, Venezuela and Bolivia. However, if the press service can acquire, or has acquired, readership in any two of the countries in 16-a above then it is felt that the total areu coverage is significant and worth maintaining. oF 17.
