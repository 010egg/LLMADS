"Agency's file on Loran Hall Blakey had called the Agency on 30 August 77 asking to see the agency's information on Loran Hall. Comment: According to testimony given:before the Warren Commission by Silvia ODIO of Dallas, Texas, three men, identifying themselves as Leopoldo, Angelo, and Leon Oswald, came to her apartment on 26 Sept 63. Leopoldo claimed he and Angelo were members of JURE (Cuban Revolutionary Junta) and wanted Silvia to meet "Leon Oswald". They introduced him as an American who was very much interested in the Cuban cause. Next day, Leopoldo called Silvia.and said (still according to Silvia) '...our idea is to introduce him (Oswald) to the underground in Cuba, because he is great, he is kind of nuts.' ‘ In response to a request dated 28 August 1964 from J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the President's Commission, the FBI initiated an investigation to identify the two men who accompanied "Leon Oswald" to Silvia's apartment. On 21 September 1964, the FBI informed Rankin that the Bureau had identified the men as Loran Eugene Hall and Lawrence Howai "Leon Oswald" was identified as William Seymour.

The system also provides a means for identifying subjects of 201 files from various categories: of information about them and for ‘producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories..Only a rela- tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi- zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre- spondence has accumulated. 2. THE 201 SYSTEM The principal features of the 201 system are: a.

RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONAL USE OF CERTAIN . CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS : 1. GENERAL a. Elemental in the conduct of clandestine operations is the use of of human gents to accomplish the missions of the Operations Directorate. In gen- eral, it it is DDO policy to select agent assets with primary regard to the agents’ abilities, target access, and secur security, and with few restrictions as to their origins, professions or status’ as members of particular groups. The basic rule is that any consenting adult may be used by. the Operations Directorate. There. are, however, certain ‘sensitive categories of individuals . Or groups whose operational use by the Operations. Directorate is prohibited »” - or, in some. way: restricted for reasons not necessarily. ‘elated. to security. considerations. - es vee fe eee a b. These prohibitions or restrictions stem from one of the following: (1) The Agency has been directed by .U.S. Governtienta authority to restrict or avoid the operational use of a parti ilar category, of in- dividuals. : (2) The Agency has entered into a sp organization, government, co: category of individuals,<\ (3) The Director or the Depi restrictions on ‘the operational 1 "due to the extreme tisk or sens ial éstrictive agreement with an 9 OF _ official | responsible for a rector for Operations has imposed ‘certain category of individuais .

Although “they are not appointed employees, contract employees are are employees of the U.S. Government. They have all . the rights and privileges granted by law to U.S. Government employees ’ . yo, : : "im accordance with their citizenship, status as well as those rights and privileges specified, in their contracts. They work under supervised con- oo: rr ny ditions and are compensated on .a- salary. basis. Contract employees are grouped Into three categories: : (a) Career Associate (Type C) Contract Employees: Contract employees who perform duties, usually of a clandestine and operational nature, ‘on @ career basis. They are normally required to demonstrate their operational value to the Agency for not } han three years, in the case of US. citizens, or not less thanfiv , in the case of foreign nationals, to qualify for career associate) .

They are not required to meet the same. security approval eriterla as staff employees and are not permitted the same access to Agency installations as staff employees or Internal contract em- ployees. They are permitted only such access to classified information as is authorized In their security approval and is required in the per- formance of their duties. « . (2) INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS are not employees of the U.S. Government, . They are self-employed { individuals who are engaged under contract to provide specific services. They receive only the compensation and benefits _considered necessary to retain their services, In the Operations Directorate, their duties are normally limited to historical research and analysis and, - to the direction, utilization, spotting, or support of agents. They normally - do hot carry out espionage or covert action tasks.
