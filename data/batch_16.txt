Rocca, Houston, Warner and myself to discuss the ramifications of the confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January. It was concluded that additiona information was required on 03 Thomas L.

Attached is a chronological rundown on the pertinent information on (Thomas L. Roberts) affiliation with the FBI, CIA and Itkin. oS 3. On 30 January,a meeting was heldwith Messrs, Houston, Warner, Rocca, and(Eugene Milligan CCS (LBGLOBE, to discuss the operational use of Mr. (Robertae3 Mr S%{Robert™ has been a Staff Agent of CIA since 28 August 1961.19 From March 1964 to Novembe 9q1964 he spent time in(West Africa) writing a monograph on (West African legal)problems. It should be noted that this task was performed under a grant from a foundation which was 03 blown in the MHDOWEL exposures, In November 1964 (Roberts) was assigned for Cover to the Radio Corporation of America z¥ legal) staff where he remained until March 1965 and then went to (Dakar) {2- (0 14-0000 izfpd 4, The facts in the attached chronology are subject to question since they are the result of (Robérte own explanation of his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from independent sources. The most critical aspect would appear to be the knowledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of 3 Roberta) affiliation with CIA. This knowledge is borne out by the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly bringé (Roberts) name into:the story which Itkin develops about his CIA affiliations. - One of the questions, to be answered by LBGLOBE personnel is whether or not (Robert? reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva, Switzerland, in March 1966, There appears to be no record of 03(Roberts') having explained why he never pursued the Itkin debt or what his financial contribution was to the (law firm of Itkin, Roberts and Greenbaum.) 08 .5. Mr. Rocca was advised:by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI - that the New York District Attorney may be conaidering prosecution against Roberts)for having abeconded with funds received from negligence cases. We do. not have sufficient information to evaluate the likelihood of criminal prosecution, It may be necessary to discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office. 0 6. With regard to Robert Délson) there appear to have been two operational considerations, one having been a request to use him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February 1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations Division for his use on Project,WUBRINY. In March 1964 DO Division advised Security that (Deleon) was not going to be used _ on WUBRINY. Mr. Rocca commented that there are some rather & ominous allegations against members of the firm of @®elson, Levin and Gordon) indicating that one member of the firm was a card- carrying member of the Communist Party.

On 24 June 1963, Mr. Charles Matt, SAS/MOB/PM, extension 6488, was referred to me by the SAS Security Officer, Mr. George Iadner, and visited me in Room 4 — 21 to request some operational support beginning 1 July 1963. Mr. Matt advised that two leaders of the Cuban Exile Group were coming to Washington, D. C., on that latter date to confer with CIA and other Government officials, including probably Robert F. Kennedy, the Attorney General, concern- ing the "new program” for the exiles, %, Mr. Matt explained that a covert site (#302 922) located at/ 9218 Aldershot Drive » Bethesda,|Maryland, had recently been procured to billet these exiles and to serve as the meeting place for these sensitive discussions to take place. Mr. Matt said that SAS is vitally interested in what these two exiles say to each other when the U. S. Government officials have departed after a day's discussions. He, therefore, requested that microphones be concealed in the house to monitor their comments. 3. Mr. Matt said that the two men would arrive on 1 July and would be in Washington at the house for about a week or ten days. . The audio coverage was requested for this entire time. Mr. Matt also said that the house would be retained for several more months <i and that the two exiles would return to Washington several more =} times in that period and that an audio surveillance would probably S| be requested for these latter visits also. — 4, Mr. George Ladner supplied the true name of the leader of ca the two men, the captioned Subject.

Page Two #210 838 (a.) Concealing a tape recorder in the attic, base- ment, or garage, and using a voice-operated relay to actuate the recorder. (b.) With the use of directories, search the environs of the safehouse for the purpose of locating a potential listening post where radio transmissions could be monitored. 5. After checking with Mr. Joseph langan, Acting Chief, Operational Support Division, I assigned the case to the District Field Office and directed some agents to case the house and the neighborhood to determine which method of penetration should be used. Mr. John Cryer was designated responsible agent at the District Field Office, and after a quick survey, he reported that the concealment and servicing of a tape recorder on the premises would be impossible and that the only method would be the use of a@ transmitter and a nearby listening post. 6. Using the directories in SRS, I ran the names of all the residents of the houses within a quarter-mile i) gthe covert site & tems SRD Indices and found ong [Fred C. Thomad> Jr.) (#57 328), of} 912T McDonald Drive, Bethesda, Maryland, to be a Starr employee. Through telephone information, located Mr.j Thomas} at the Langley Headquarters Building and personally contacted him the first thing in the morning of 25 June 1963. I indicated to Mr. (Th g]}the fact that there was a safehouse in his neighborhood which we wanted to "bug" and that he was the only Staff employee who lived within range of our covert transmitters. I asked him if it would be too mich of an pags ton 6m him for us to set up a listening post in_his house. Mr. [Théwhs \explained that he was scheduled to depart for [Karachi, i 0 Pakistan} on a PCS assignment in approximately a month but that he would bé“glad to make his home available as listening post. He confided that his primary mission in/Karachi jwas to be the audio a) penetration of the] Commnist Chinese Embassy land so_he would look . uf forward to the next week's operations in his”home as valuable Fo training. The next step I took was to set up & meeting among George Ladner, Charles Matt, Sam Halpern, Executive Officer of SAS, and myself in Mr. Halpern's Office. I advised Mr. Halpern that the 14-00000 } SECRET .° Page Three #210 838 audio surveillance appeared to: be technically feasible since I had located a possible listening post. However, I admitted to him that, even though the Office of Security has the "charter" to conduct the surveillance, TSD controls the necessary expensive equipment; Mr. Halpern mist arrange for TSD to transfer this equipment to the Office of Security. Mr. Halpern declared that the procurement of the necessary equipment should pose no problem after he would mike a few telephone calls. I then returned to my office and made out a list of the equipment which I felt would be necessary, and awaited advice from him as to whom to contact in TSD to obtain it. 03 7. After checking with ur. (Bi T, Bentlof the Audio Opera- tions Branch of TSD as to appropriate equipment and after check- ing through the specifications in the "Audio Manual" of TSD, I selected the following: Two voice-cperated relays, QSC-2, $2,200.00 $1,100 each Two Transmitter Radios, FM, 130 - 140 550.00 MCS, SRT-6H, @ $275 each . Two Battery Packs, 130 hrs. ops., 50.00 UWB-7, $25 each Two Battery "A", 1.5 volts, Burgess 2 F 1.08 $ . 54 each One Battery "B", 45 volts, Burgess A-30 1.87 $1.87 each TOTAL $2,802.95 8. About Noon on 25 June, I received a telephone call from Mr. John W. McBee, extension aksi, of TSD, who told me that every- thing had been laid on by SAS for me to obtain from TSD any SECRET 14-00000 O IT Q ri 4 7 Page Four #210 838 equipment necessary for this operation. Mr. McBee directed that I fill out a Form #88 and have the technicians hand carry it to the Franconia Depot in order to obtain the equipment. The use of the Form #88 disturbed me in this matter because I had assumed from Mr. Halpern that he would arrange it so that TSD would turn over the equipment to us without charge to anyone. ‘The use of the Form #88 implies that a division is allocating funds for the purchase of equipment. However, I filled out the Form #88, listing the above equipment, and walked it down to SAS, where I gave it to Charles Matt to have signed. The form, bearing the SAS Cost Center #3132-5455-3400, was completed and returned to me within an hour, whereupon I gave it to DFO Agent Stan Lach, who drove with it immediately to the Franconia Depot. I called ahead to Bob Woods and Charlie Beall of the T & I Shop at Franconia and requested that they give a little briefing concerning the operation of this equipment to Mr. Lach and Mr. Cryer, who was to meet Mr. Lach there. Neither Cryer nor Lach had eyer had any experience with any of the pieces of equipment on the list. Mr. Woods and Mr. Beall were quite cooperative in this request. 9. Several problems kept appearing and disappearing while the DFO technicians were transporting, installing, and testing the equipment. One problem was the payment of the equipment. I; received a telephone call from Mr. Dayton S. ("Doc") Barrows of TSD, informing me that SAS had reneged on paying the $2,802.95 for the equipment, but that if I would tell him what equipment we wanted, he might be able to arrange to lend it to us. I told Mr. Barrows that as far as I knew, we had indeed obtained the equipment with the Form #88, but that if we needed anything else, I would contact him. Another problem which appeared was the rumor that it was not two Cuban exiles who would be residing in the safehouse, but only the captioned Subject and a Spanish speaking Staff employee. If the rumor were actually true, it would seem that an audio surveillance of the safehouse would not be necessary. I called Charles Matt for an explanation, and he informed me that Senor Artime was going to be the only person living in the house after each day's discussions were completed - no Staff employee would be living with him. I asked Mr. Matt to whom Senor Artime would be - ry IT] =| { 14-0000 creme i) ry ri —| ui Page Five #210 838 holding the conversations which we were to record, He replied that he was interested in any visitors which the Subject might receive and any telephone calls which he might mike. I suggested that possibly a telephone tap might be sufficient under these circumstances. Mr. Matt disagreed and still requested a micro- phone installation to cover the whole house if possible. 10. In addition to the equipment obtained from TSD, the DFO agents took their own SRR-4 tuneable receiver and the SRR-4 charged to the WFO. These receivers would be used in the listening post to pick up the radiations from the two SRT-6H transmitters. It was suggested to the DFO agents to borrow the two WFO transceivers to be used to commmicate during the installation between the listening post and the safehouse; however, the agents chose not to use them and relied solely on telephonic commmications. The "A" and "B" batteries picked up at Franconia were to be used in the SRR-4 receiver so that checks could be made from an automobile to see just how far the radiations extended around the transmitters. A report on the area covered by the transmitters was requested of the DFO agents. { ll. The first test of the SRI-6H from the safehouse to the / listening post was a failure. Its 50 milliwatt output, ordinarily { good for a quarter mile, wasn't sufficient to reach the receiver, i i ! 2/loth's of a mile away, Its failure was blamed partly on the distance, partly on the brick construction of the listening post, and partly on the hilly contours of the housing development, which deflected the 135 megacyele, line-of-sight radiations. 12. When this disheartening news arrived, I immediately telephoned Mr. Barrows of TSD and requested a pair of the more powerful 150 milliwatt SRT-7 transmitters. I telephoned Mr. Barrows rather than filling out another Form #88 to avoid a possible furor within SAS. Mr. Barrows consented to loan two of these transmitters with their proper receivers on a hand receipt to us, and Stan Lach was dispatched to Franconia to pick them up. An opportunity to test it on 28 June 1963 was thwarted because Mr. S]was having foreign visitors in for cocktails fuukbesime that afternoon. But the equipment was installed and tested the next day, Saturday, 29 June, and appeared to work satisfactorily.

Elsie L SCALETTI recalls that Raymond A. FRADYER, Chief of the Cuban Section, tried to get Agee to discuss the development of contacts with access to the Cuban target in the Olympics. In these Sieeussions it may well be that Agee was tojJd about LIARM-1, (4 member of the“Mexican rifle team, who was a contact(of the ‘Station jand we, were trying to get invited to Cuba, 9% (LIARM-1 is no longer a contact fof the ‘Sttionleven though he is still with {the rifle team. J/ - 2. SCALETTI recalls the Cuban Section feeling very frustrated that Agee could provide no leads or assistance to this Section in its effort to target against the Cuban teams. She recalls no memoranda prepared by Agee for the Section, no leads given the Section, and ne came to discuss the olympics with C/Cuba not more than half a dozen times. - $. As SCALETTI recalls, it is unlikely that Agee knew any thing about the operations being run against the Cuban targer pan that which he might have atl picked up at Headquarters or known about {the onjoperations in general --. such as audio, surveillance, photo surveillance, etc. 4, SCALETTI had Agee over to her home once for dinner; there were - no other guests. Agee had SCALETTI, her husband, and Laura J, UTSTINE _ob (on TDY) to his apartment once for dinner. The conversation was alway yon Ca light. The only significant thing about Agee's plans which arose was his discussion about buying used drycleaning equipment in the United States, bringing it to Mexico and setting up a.drycleaning plant, This was brought up as something for the future and just an igea Phil was toying with. fre Moland 5, SCALETTI ran into Agee by chance on the side street by the Embassy one day after the arrival ohn A.

Scaletti PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT: - | knew Phil during the entire time he was in Branch | at Headquarters, and during his tour in Mexico. | We came to Mexico PCS at the same time. - This means | knew him from. 1966 until he resigned. in Headquarters our relationship was limited to business in the office, and that. was‘‘not very: —. frequent. We sat in different rooms. He handled SB matters. { did the routing of all Branch . correspondence which meant I decided what he was to _see--this was anything affecting Soviet/Satellite/ Chinese matters.. My main.areas. of responsibility were. in the support field. Even though we were both processing out at the same time, we did not exchange stories much. However, since | traveled as a "Tourist" and was not therefore allowed to bring anything into Mexico, Phil offered to have some of my things packed with his household effects since he said he owned hardly anything. .One day my husband and | took sone boxes of things over to his apartment before work. 1! do not remember the name of the apartment development in Virginia, ‘but it was the garden type. His apartment was nice--fairly new but sparsely furnished, He helped us) unload the things aid take them upstairs. Then we parted, | seem to recal ine had some trouble witn his car that morning and we dropped him off at a repair shop on the way to the office. . Lo , At this time, in Washington, Phil was very pleasant, was nice to.work with. He did not appear to be pushy, even though hedid everything he could to get the Mexican assignment. At this time, despite his family problems, ne did not appear to let these affect inis work. At least from my position he seemed to get his work done, not to procrastinate, not to take a lot of time off. Fron the gossip 1 heard,. he was separated, and was anxious to get any assignmeat overseas. When the possidility of this Olympic job opened up in Mexico he grabbed’ it. As 1 recalty C/WH/} was sympathetic toward him also, and was happy to be able to nelp Phi] at this particular time. SECRET/SENSITIVE =» Ye. SECRET/SENSETI VE Tee » In Mextco when PATT*s nouseirovd effects arrived he let me know; and as ! recall, ne brought them over to my ijouse and we unloaded them into our apartment. We did not go and pick them up. In thanks, we invited him over to supper one evening. (Willard C. CURTIS had given permission for individual officers to have Phil over to dinner if no outsiders were present and prior permission was obtained.) | think { got permission from the DCOS at that time, There were only the three of us (Phil, my husband, ‘and myself--no maid, no other invited guests) There was no discussion of office. My husband knew Phil was with BKTRUST and was working on the Olympics in Mexico. Conversation was light. During dinner,. as } recall, we talked about business in Mexico, and he mentioned, his father was in the dry-cleaning business, and he thought he might be interested in’ pringing into Mexico some used dry cleaning equipment which is worth nothing in the United States, and set up sone dry cleaning establishments in Mexico,. The discussion was merely in generalities--nothing specific as to timetable or even if Phil were serious about this. About a week later Phil brought his car over and my husband helped him work on his car--adjusting it to the altitude, This must have been around September 1957. . Shortly thereafter, when Laura B. UTSTINE was in Mexico TDY (she worked in WH/1] and also knew Phil at Headquarters), Phil had my husband, me, and UTSTINE over to his apartment (on Insurgentes Sur just off the Viaducto) for dinner. It was,.a huge. apartment, sparse hy furnished. We had an enjoyable evening, very light conversation. Talked mostly about Mexico, At this time he showed us he nad several bedrooms (forget how many) and hopefully his sons would be able to visit him. During his tour in Mexico | only saw Phil in the Station occasionally--and then just in passingin the halls. Once after | heard about Phil's having kidnapec his boys, | thought | saw them (can't remember why | thought they were his) in front of the Embassy with a maid. | never saw Phil in the Embassy proper nor at any Embassy functions (1 was tourist and did not circulate in the Embassy).

Although 1 rememoer no close friendshi,. between Ex-LIADLI8 and Phil on the desk, tne fact they sat togetner, were poth processing out for Mexico, would have meant they nad something in common.
