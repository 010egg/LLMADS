The purpose of this memersinns: ‘ia to ecolineste an operational pina for the action which we " believe should be taken by CIA ogainst Cuban fur the predictahls future, In‘ guamary the plan provides for ccntinuing, even intensifying, the intelligence effort egeinst Cubs and for the reorientation of the current effort into » long tern denied area type of operation of the highest priority. I, ASSUMPTIONS: ‘A. The United States Government will give public assurances that, provided no nuclerr or offeusive weapers = 2r present or re-introduced into Cuba, end provided Cubr deer not take netdon to threaten the perce. -ond security of tke | 14-00000 ® These assurances will preclude eny ‘meaningful CIA action ‘on a phesed basis to provoke a revolt inside Cubz, sinve unless there are major changes in operational and internal con- - ; ditions: in Cuba, such a revolt if provoked would be totally deatroyed Py Cuban counteraction in aR. matter of hours or, ot es a practical matter will, preclude invading Cuba on the pretext ‘of a contrived provocation such as en attack on Guantanamo. 2Ce CIA operations: involving a. high noise level anda * diaeadet ‘elenent of ‘attributability, particularly paramilitary, " guerrilly,. and conmande type operations will. be unacceptable as a matter of ‘policy. De The Castro-communist regime will remain in power for ‘the indefinite. future, with its security and coatrol apparatus relatively intact and with the capability not only of crushing , unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational . conditions 1a Cuba increasingly difficult. While it. is possible that recent and future developments including the Soviet action in renoving the offensive weapons from Cube nury serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there is as yet no hard indication that the control of the Castro-coanunist regime over “ae ‘uhd toca rabetactity weakenod, . ., The _Vaited States assurances of no invasion and no - support of: an invesion will, in effect, constitute giving tc Castro and his regime a certain degree of sonctuary. This will 14-00000 { i’ severely denoge the aorale and motivation of anti-regine Cubene | both inside sad. outside of Cuba, ‘which will make it ineresaingiy ‘ : “ dattioult for us to. recruit agents, maintain agents already recruited, and. continue or intensify our intelligence and other efforts against Cuba and the Castro-communist regine. oy a 2a 7 Be Despite. the Sbove. factozs,; Higher.

Uaited States Government, we believe, . jc - will be unwilling in the. immediate future to commit troops ’ to support such, an overthrow. The United States Governnent in its overt dealings with the Cuben exiles probably will not "express. ‘the above factors to them in the context or with the bluntness: stated here, . /G. In view of these factors, the so-called “Irzck Tro", . course of action, 4.6., unlimited support of Cuban exiles and exile ETOUpS. with no real control or objective purposes in the hope that ‘these groups will be able to shake the _ Castro regiae will, although unrealistic, become _increzs ing ty attractive at various levels in the United Sta tes Government. ; H.

Set out below aro specifics of operational action it is proposed to take to continue and, as possible, increase ne telligence coverage of Cube. 1. fatelligence Exploitetion of Refugees: As you know, with the quarantine and the cessation of sir braver t the heavy’ flow of Cuban refugees haa dwindled e almost to nothing. In view of this and in connection yes with the contingency pilenning for supporting any persibis mjiitary sotion in Cube, the Opa-Locks Interrogation - ) Canter as auch was disaantied, : although. the personnel of. the Center have been retained intact. In order to - re-astablish. the flow of intelligence from refugees, it is. proposed that. Pan Auerican Airveys and KLY be * taducea to. ‘relnatitute their: regular’ flights from Havana to Miams.’ This should be done as scon a3 " possible after the settlement of the current nogotizttons and UN discussions. Coincident with this, _the Opa-Locka vefugee’ interrogation center will be re-established , with the sane personnel. - Resident Agents in Cuba: Every effort will be ‘aade to continue to exploit to the fullest, preserve the viability of and, where necesssry, re-establish commimica- ' tieas: with the isi recruited agents now resident in Cube. To an ‘extent, the speed and effectiveness of this effort _ wll of course depend upon the stringency of future Cuban security snd control action, which it is impossible as yet to accurately forecast. 3. Third Country Operations: The priority on re- cruiting agents in third countries for dispatch to Cubs will be reiterated gnd strengthened and every effort . is will be made to jucreage. this coverage, both through “the dsvelopaent of additional resident agents in ‘Cuba oTe- ‘ 14-00000 We. will, continue to _preas gon services] wan are assisting us in the effort - agninst Cuba: for additional coverage, including the “ wecruiting of agents within their own areas for joint wry dtepateh, to Cada. .

SZULC was born on 25 July 1926 in Warsaw, Poland. He arrived in Brazil from Lisbon on 3 August 1940, and came to the U.S. in October 1947 under sponsorship of U.S. Ambassador _ John C. WILEY, the husband of his mother's sister. He became a correspondent for the New York Times (NYT) in 1953, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1954 by a special Congressional bill. a 2. SZULC has been under suspicion as a hostile foreign agent since 1948 when the FBI reported (apparently from a \\ British) source) that he was a Communist. He brought ‘himself to the attention of CIA in August 1959 in Santiago, Chile by claiming (falsely) to be "cleared" and requesting contact with an Agency representative. This was the first of many such incidents in Latin America, and resulted in a warning to all Latin American Stations to beware of SZULC and his efforts to interview Agency personnel. It also resulted in continuing watch of his movements and activities because they represented a threat to the cover of Agency personnel. By 1960 his reputa- tion was so widespread that several different CIA officers called for an investigation that would clear up "once and for all" his suspected connections with a hostile intelligence service. He was in frequent contact with Communist Party leaders and functionaries throughout Latin America, constantly sought out and elicited information from U.S. Embassy officers, frequently mentioning the name of other CIA officers with whom he was acquainted. 3. Although the suspicions have increased, and SZULC's | anti- Agency activities have become much more serious and blatant in the 1970's, it has not been possible to clear up aerednctan bive any of the suspicions about his motives or his possible connections with a foreign intelligence service. There have been numerous reviews of his files and the interest in his activities has extended from the case officer. level to the DCI. In fact, it is not possible to come to any clear conclusion about this man, and the notes below are simply illustrative wo . of the kinds of things that keep the suspicions alive. It is important to note that SZULC's activities can be explained by the combination of his personality, ambition, and the demands on an investigative reporter for the NYT. He is an aggressive, insensitive, and persistent journalist with the family connections (Ambassador Wiley) and ability to develop the kinds of contacts appropriate to a successful correspondent for a paper like the NYT. 4. Nevertheless, there are elements throughout his entire career thee are almost designed to. arouse suspicion. For example, a Britisil source in Rio de Janeiro (see Attachment A) reported that SZULC was "directed" by the Polish regime in Warsaw to seek employment in U.S. journalistic circles. This report runs like a thread throughout his file and is repeated _and garbled in several versions over the years. The report H&R 7 ms . 2 . .has never been adequately explained and was apparently never 5-0. { . reported in full to [London by the (British representative in BRET - i - Rio. This report and other questions that arose early in his career (his contacts with a cousin who was a Press Attache in the Polish Embassy in Rio) were, however, just the earliest elements that aroused suspicion. 5. Because he became so well-known to so many Agency ' ‘ officers, his name and reputation have become subject of ro discussion on many occasions. One senior operations officer . stated in 1975 that a Soviet agent could not be more beneficial to the Soviets and the Communist cause than SZULC has been. Although he presented a generally anti-Communist view prior to quitting the NYT in 1972, it is noteworthy that he arranged extensive, favorable TV coverage of the Communist-dominated Ligas Campesinas in Northeast Brazil and that one of the most important anti-Castro operations, AMTRUNK, in which he was involved fromthe beginning, was disastrous for all participants. More indicative of his true beliefs, however, are the articles he has written since Watergate. They have become increasingly critical of the CIA and of the USG generally and have damaged U.S. image and prestige. . 6. The notes below are somewhat random examples of elements in SZULC's file that bring him under suspicion. As mentioned above, they in no way point to a firm conclusion. For further information on SZULC during the period 1963 - 1964, see the CI review prepared at Miami Station on Jorge VOLSKY in 1964, i Byeg 218K Bester a. The 1948 FBI report that SZULC was involved in supplying the Polish Legation in Rio with information from his personal contacts and from Ambassador John C. Wiley has been repeated in various versions throughout SZULC's file. The FBI has found similar allegations made by other sources who knew SZULC at that time. In addition, ‘several sources have mentioned SZULC's relations with his cousin, Ignacy SACHS, who was the Press Attache in the Polish Embassy in 1947 and 1948, although there is no indication that SACHS had intelligence connections. - b. SZULC's marriage to the daughter of the American manager of the English language newspaper in Rio de Janeiro, the Herald, lasted only until SZULC had permanent residence in the U.S. and appears to have been carried through for that purpose. c. By 1949 (SZULC was only 23) he had come to the attention of the [Rio Stat ion because of his dealings with the Polish Legation and because investigation revealed his father had some (apparently innocent) business dealings with Russians visiting Brazil from Mexico, d. In 1954, about a year after he was hired by the NYT, SZULC obtained a sensational story, by telephone, from a Communist leader in Guatemala. This launched his career with the NYT. e. In 1956 SZULC was ‘investigating Brazilian nuclear policy for the NYT. Although a legitimate topic, it was somewhat unusual for him and the timing seems unusual for NYT interest. : - pee oe vK £. In 1959, on a trip to Santiago, Chile, SZULC claimed to be "cleared" and requested an interview with an Agency representative. This was the first of humerous such requests. In addition, it was in about 1959 that he. also began making a point of telling Agency personnel the names of other Agency officers he had identified. g. An article SZULC wrote on Cuba for the NYT in December 1959 was hailed as an antidote to the excessively favorable reports of his colleague, Herbert MATTHEWS, but in fact his article was largely favorable to Fidel CASTRO and to CASTRO's plans for Cuba. It is only in comparison piece/can - be considered balanced. h. By September 1960, SZULC was in the forefront of those advocating action against CASTRO. (it was he who finally brought the Leonardo Plan to Washington in 1963. . See AMTRUNK Operational paper). i. In April 1961, shortly after John F. KENNEDY was innaugurated, SZULC_was transferred to Washington by the NYT. Although a reasonable transfer, it is noteworthy that in a very short time SZULC claimed that he had a standing invitation to go directly to the President, the Vice President, the Attorney General, McGeorge BUNDY and Robert HURWITCH on Cuban matters. i 1 | 7 i fi ! j. SZULC persistently sought a continuing contact with an Agency representative in Washington shortly after he arrived until it was granted in December 1962. The first contact was with Albert C. DAVIES (Lt. Col. on military detail to CIA - Cuba), and was arranged at the behest of Colonel GROGAN, the Assistant to the Director, on SZULC's request. k. In early 1963, at President _XENNEDY ' s urging, 7 contact with SZULC was made into a formal relationship and was continued until October 1964. The meetings were used by SZULC to cross check his information from other sources, including various Cuban exiles and the Department of State. He became, by virtue of his contacts with the exile community and throughout Washington, one of the most knowledgeable people in the area of Cuban affairs, anti- CASTRO activities, and U.S. Government policy. (See cI study on Jorge VOLSKY for more information on this period.) 1. The Agency officer, Alfonso RODRIGUEZ, who main- tained official contact with SZULC in 1963 and 1964 said in July 1964: "The special friendship and mutual admiration society that has existed between Tad SZULC, Jorge VOLSKY, and Manuel RAY and the JURE is not something that is transparent or easily explained. This alliance may be something unholy and Machiavellian; I just do not know, but I can find no evidence to prove it." te ferg ty D000 ; e 7 -m. Another officer, Seymour Young, wrote in 1965: "After reading and re-reading this man's various ——------ + files, I began to feel that this man in his position would be an ideal ‘agent of influence’. It was noted that he is always in a crisis area and usually in advance of the crisis and writes articles which are more concerned with the Communist successes." n. In about’ August 1965, SZULC was sent to Madrid as the NYT representative for Spain and Portugal. He stayed overseas until December 1968. He was present in Prague during the Soviet invasion of August 1968 and in December he was expelled, apparently for being too inquisitive. However, the [West German Service \has remained suspicious of the circumstances of SZULC's expulsion and the details have never been clarified. (It is interesting that SZULC wrote articles reflecting the official CZECH line concerning the defection of General Jan SEJNA who was in the Czech Intelligence service.) | 0. SZULC was reported by an FBI source to have gone horseback riding with Boris Vv. YAROCHEVSKIY, a suspect KGB officer, in Washington in June or July 1971. SZULC's file reflects no regular contact with Bloc diplomats. p. In 1972 and 1973 SZULC covered Watergate extensively and demonstrated an e¢trenp bias against the CIA. By P July 1972, SZULC's inquiries of the Department of State \ and his articles had taken on a distinctly anti-US Govern- ment tone. His coverage of guerrilla and terrorist groups ft PRee - wil bay mae 1c&R } was less sure than in earlier days and was frequently sensationalist and full of inaccuracies. (See, especially, article in NYT for 14 July 1972 on a terrorist Headquarters “ in Zurich and other wild statements.) | q. -Since 1974 SZULC's articles have been highly critical of the Agency and he has used the background Ly information he gathered in the 1960's to attack the Agency and to criticize its operations. r. In May 1975 SZULC accused the Agency of rifling the files of U.S. Senators. This was only one of many irresponsible and false articles he wrote trying to ais- credit the Agency. One of the more spectacular efforts was a series in Esquire magazine, in which, among other things, he charged that the U.S. intelligence community had a hidden budget of $25 billion dollars and a network -of 200,000 spies. s. In, Inside the Company: A CIA Diary, Philip AGEE ‘credits SZULC's daughter, Nicole, for having "obtained vital research materials in New York and Washington, D.c." There is reason to believe, particularly in view of the extreme views Tad SZULC has manifested in the past two years, that he may have aided his daughter in her "research." SUMMATION The case against Tad SZULC as a foreign agent is weak. However, his most recent activities are entirely consonant with the view that he has already served the Soviets well and can 8 ra a SuRel 1g-00000 end his career as an overt propagandist taking advantage of the current furor over the CIA to do the greatest possible ) . ? damage.

Any use of the SECRET/SENSITIVE attachment requires C/CI approval.) The source reported that Nicole, while working with the DGI in Cuba to. éxpose the Agency, said that except for her father, her whole family were "fascists." She said that her father quit the NYT because of the restrictive editorial policy and he wished to write according to his beliefs. d3 LAD/JFK Tas Force 1977/Marty Miller} rp 2 Attachments, a/s Copy filed: 201-50539 > er ry Sito re [Ge;, 14 January 1977 MEMORANDUM SUBJECT: Jose Ricardo RABEL Nunez (AMLEO-3) (201-249386) 1. Born 7 April 1922 in Havana, Cuba, the son of a native-born American citizen, RABEL was brought up in comfor- table circumstances. He attended high school in Cuba, com- pleted the last year in New Orleans, Louisiana, and entered Tulane University in September 1938. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in December 1940 and eventually saw combat in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria. After discharge in December 1945, RABEL returned to Cuba to attend the University of Havana and this began a life of job changes, moving back and forth between the U.S. and Cuba, and, in general, rootless living. 2. RABEL's background reads like that of a man with no allegiances.or loyalties and no particular goals. Viewed in retrospect, his career presents a picture of unreliability. It is probable that RABEL's rootlessness and apparent unreliability applied both to his relations with CASTRO and to those with the Agency. It is quite possible, therefore, that he not only served the Agency in a superficial way but that he did the same for CASTRO at various times when it suited his purposes. Without postulating this sort of: dual role (one which fits very well with his previous life) it is almost impossible to explain some of the reasonably good things he did for the Agency and the quite certain allegations that he was a CASTRO agent. This explanation is not fully satis- factory, but it does explain his career better than the charge RETURN TO ¢ Background Use a . Do Not Reproduce” ae \2Az> i) that he was a CASTRO agent from the beginning. The question that must remain unanswered is whether he betrayed the AMTRUNK Operation. He was not arrested until September 1965 (when AMTRUNK had already run its course) but it appears quite certain that he cooperated with the DSE after his arrest and while he was in prison. 3. RABEL joined in the clandestine activities against BATISTA in March 1952, first amongst. the exiles in the U.S. and then after late 1952 from inside Cuba. He joined the Cuban armed forces to further his plotting and was assigned to the Cuban General Staff. He was the Cuban liaison officer with the U.S. Army mission in Cuba from November 1954 until . April 1956. During his entire period in the Cuban army, RABEL was involved with dissident Army elements; when they attempted a coup in April 1956, RABEL’ was arrested. He was released shortly thereaftet, worked in the chicken business for a year and then returned to the U.S; and worked with one of his brothers (Luis RABEL Nunez). In October 1957 he returned to Cuba and became involved with the 26th of July Movement but had to leave a year later when he was brought to the attention of the BATISTA forces because of a bomb explosion. He smuggled weapons to Camilo Cienfuegos for, about a year and then in October 1958 he joined the Cienfuegos group. Shortly after the CASTRO victory, CASTRO called upon RABEL to set up a Cuban Marine Corps, a job he held until February 1960, at which time he was appointed Chief of Viviendas Campesinas. 2 . @ . He held this job until he defected to the U.S. in December 1962. It is worth noting that he rarely pursued one activity in one place for more than a year at a time from 1945 to 1962. 4. RABEL gave Alfonso RODRIGUEZ the following reasons for his defection: , a. Communist pressure, hounding, and the basic enmity of the Communist Party toward him. (This appears very reasonable in view of his service in the U.S. Army and training in some aspects of intelligence, such as prisoner interrogation. In addition, his schooling in the U.S. and the reasonable economic circumstances would not have been recommendations from the Communist point of view.) b. Strong backing by Fidel which protected him from more serious attacks from the Party. (This, too, seems entirely reasonable. His family farm was near the farm Fidel's father managed and RABEL and Fidel had known each other as children. In addition, RABEL's long involvement in the anti-BATISTA movement and with Camilo Cienfuegos were probably in his favor in CASTRO's view.) c. An obligation to protect the non-Communists in his department, which prevented his earlier defection, and uncertainty of his reception in the U.S. (In view of the number of defections from RABEL's department, there were, in fact, people to protect. Since RABEL had served in the U.S. Army, and probably felt the U.S. was his second hed 14-0000 SEGRET country, he could well have had questions about his reception after serving in the CASTRO government.) —_—d.—--His resenthent against the confining nature of a Communist State. (Since he never stayed in one. place more than a short time in his entire life, to have been restricted to Cuba must have seemed Oy tShnent -) 5. RABEL was used to pitch[Dr. Marta ‘FRAYDE Barrauejin Garisin Gu y}1963, and to check out leads for the AMTRUNK Operation. One of his leads led to the recruitment of AMTRUNK-10. Later,in early 1964, RABEL was leader of the Rebel Army Group supported by the American Legion in Miami and-was involved in the Rebel Army Radio program. 6. There is no specific evidence (except the accusations below) that RABEL was involved in a suspicious way with the CASTRO regime during this period, but his desire to exfiltrate his wife and children was a constant source of difficulty between him and the Station. This problem led to his eventual termination in July 1964 and to a great deal of resentment on his part. “He conspired constantly, from mid-1963 until his capture in Cuba in September 1965, to get-into Cuba to exfiltrate his wife and children. 7. RABEL was sentenced: to 30 years imprisonment but was set free in July or August 1967, which is a strong indication that the charges that he worked for the DSE while in prison were true. Moreover, there is some indication that he may have attempted a provocation at Cuban behest: immediately after his —_—" capture. There are two firm accusations that RABEL was a SEGAL | a _ Cuban agent as early as July 1963 (which would have been when he was screening names for the AMTRUNK Operation), one 3 - fron (ETAMIL-5} and the other from Fernando REY reported by (WASLoucH-1. be true; yet RABEL could have fulfilled his duties for CASTRO As mentioned above, these charges could well superficially, for his own purposes, and not necessarily have compromised his work with the Agency until he was captured. The difficulties he had in exfiltrating his wife could have been, partially, punishment by CASTRO for not fulfilling his duties as an agent; otherwise, had his work in the U.S. been valuable, CASTRO could have facilitated the exfiltration of RABEL's wife so that RABEL could continue his work as an agent undisturbed.

MORENO was born on 25 August 1921 in Havana, Cuba. His: father was a Cuban Senator (1940-44) and the Cuban Minister of Public Works (1944). MORENO became a lawyer and continued i to live in comfortable circumstances. He became involved in the anti-BATISTA movement, apparently in the late 1950's, and ultimately in the 26th of July Movement. After the revolution, one of his clients was Camilo CIENFUEGOS. In Miami after defection, he was associated with the JURE. 2. MORENO's specific activities in the anti-BATISTA Movement were not reported and apparently were unexceptional. A point worth noting about his activities before defection is his acquaintance with Tad SZULC, at least by 1959, and with Jorge VOLSKY. MORENO's background as a lawyer did not prepare him for active revolutionary involvement. When he defected in ' April 1961, therefore, he associated with anti-CASTRO exiles, particularly VOLSKY, but did not become actively involved. He was assessed in 1963 as being unfriendly to CIA. 3. About February 1963 MORENO. and Enrique: CAYADO Ribera ‘reportedly collaborated in the formulation of an operational plan to overthrow the Castro government. They discussed it with Jorge VOLSKY, who then passed it to Tad SZULC. VOLSKY and SZULC apparently conspired to have the plan presented to the "political authorities" (Robert HURWITCH and the KENNEDY Administration) in Washington in order to by-pass. the dis- fF 00993 trusted "operational authorities" (the CIA). (VOLSKY originally took full credit for the plan, called "Leonardo Plan," which eventually became known as the AMTRUNK Operation.) 4. The Leonardo Plan was well‘thought—out and caught the fancy of the KENNEDY Administration. HURWITCH bought it to the CIA with the blessings of the Department of State. Thus, from the very beginning, SZULC, VOLSKY, and MORENO, each of whom had outside interests to some degree in conflict with AMTRUNK, were involved in AMTRUNK. policy and planning meetings. Moreover, all three were to some degree antipathetic to the Agency for various reasons and were difficult or impossible to control. 5. MORENO's indiscretions were a serious problem that limited his effectiveness as a direct participant in the AMTRUNK Operation by arousing the concern of other participants. While the Station attempted to cut out VOLSKY and SZULC after, the initial policy discussions in Washington, VOLSKY always remained involved to some degree and kept SZULC fully informed. Under . the circumstances, the censure of MORENO for talking to SZULC was just an attempt to plug one of many leaks. The fact is that MORENO, SZULC, and VOLSKY believed they had an inside track in Washington because of their contacts there and all three disliked following Agency instructions that conflicted with their own diverse interests. However, because JMWAVE Station and AMICE-14 (Miguel A. DIAZ Isalgue) objected to MORENO's continued involvement in the AMTRUNK Operation after learning of his free talk with SZULC and others, the Station terminated MORENO’ s involvement sin the sensitive aspects or of AMTRUNK in November 1963. 6. Since MORENO was one of the original authors of _ AMTRUNK and already disliked the Agency, one can imagine his feelings at that juncture. He sulked, refused at first to take a position on the Rebel Army Radio Program, and caused problems in general. By January 1964 MORENO was actually interferring in the AMTRUNK Operation (by giving demoralizing, conflicting information to AMTRUNK-9, for example) and attempting to debrief returnees on behalf of VOLSKY and SZULC. MORENO was fired, therefore, by RABEL on Station instructions, from the Rebel Army Radio Program in February 1964 and termin- ated by the Station as of 5 March. 7. Shortly after his termination, MORENO, using VOLSKY as an intermediary, approached Mr. G. Harvey SUMM with a proposal similar to the Leonardo Plan. The COS met with SUMM on 1 April 1964 and advised him how to put off MORENO. 8. In August or September 1964, MORENO left Miami and took a position as a Spanish-language professor in South Carolina. CONCLUSION: ; MORENO apparently’ was a sincere anti-CASTRO revolutionary, but his dislike for and distrust of the Agency, which was undoubtedly stimulated by SZULC and VOLKSY, made his involve- ment in AMTRUNK a lia@bility to the security of the operation. It appears that MORENO, like many Cubans of the upper middle RET class, had little sense of security. It is obvious that he trusted SZULC and VOLSKY far beyond what normal prudence would dictate. He probably was not a CASTRO agent, but he did help leak operational details and general plans to people who helped to spread the information more widely and who, themselves, were not trustworthy. oF.

STATUS REPORT ON TRAINING AND PROCESSING, 4-31 MARCH, ee . . The AMTRUNK Team, consisting of AMICE/27, AMICE/14, AMTRUNK/2, ‘and AMTRUNK/3 were safehoused on 4 March 1963 at Safesite #164 on Plantation Key. Andrew S, PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from headquarters, was already at the training site when the team was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N. PEGGINS and Hobart J. VANDEBORN. PARMERS remained at the safesite until 16 March during which time he conducted training in clandestine methods and techniques. This training included security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica- tions, agent spotting, selection, recruitment and management, and operational planning and reporting. The training included group discussion and participation in a series of ‘appropriate operational situations, several problems, and daily physical training. During this two week period, either PEGGINS or VANDEBORN visited the safesite every day, spending an average of two or three hours with the group in operational dis- | cussions and processing. During the week of 18 thru 23 March, ‘both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group, ‘debriefing them in detail on their operational contacts, workin out operational details of their infiltration, and continuing their training on an informal basis. The week of 25 through 30 March was spent in PM-type training with emphasis on compass -and map reading, including two night problems, and on weapons familiarization and firing. During the period under dis- ” cussion the AMTRUNK group were all LCFLUTTERED, were assessed OO by the KUROAR assessment team, were given an initial series ' of immunizations, were issued clothing, were processed: for _ alias documentation, were processed for disguises, and were further processed on cover and finance problems. The re- sults of the LCFLUTTER examinations were sent to headquarters under cover of UFGA-8111, on 13 March 1963, Based on DIR : 26430, no further LCFLUTTER is planned at the present time.

Pre- arranged signals will also be dévised for usé by the team via telegram.to indicate their progress and confirm their place and timé of exfiltration. Both mémbérs will also be given an OWVL system to provide them with quick instructions in case of an emergency. OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY _ EVALUATION 1. The operational aspects of Phase I portrays a mission which has considerable potential but also considérable risk. The area of infiltration is within five miles of a cruisé missile site and its accompanying radar. .In addition boat patrols are kaown to work this portion of ‘the coast at frequent ititérvals. “Once infiltrated the team will not have to travel far before their first contact. However, A/3 is leary of staying at his . for any length of time and hé does not want his ; to know of his présence in Cuba. For this reason the ‘farm will not be able to serve as a Safehouse, A/2 plans on leaving the farm the same d _lands. This presents the .On approach is to také A/3 14-00000 as € 4 wth to Guanabo or Havana and safehouse him. This, howéver, may jeopardize the operation becausé A/3 lacks the maturity and patience nécessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his busi- ness. Hé may take advantage of his visit to Havana to under= take a clandéStineé assignment on his own. When A/2 and 3 step ashore in Cuba; Control will vanish. Fortunately A/2 -haS a sufficient Yesource of judgement to g6 about his busi= ness competently. Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication. For this reasot an attempt will be made to Steer A/3 towards developing assets around his €@£ with maritime recéption capabilities. 2. A/2, on the other hand, appears to have a sufficient -numbe of ‘Supporting assets to provide for his safety while in Havana However, hé has not seen @a } m for over a yéai. In addition both men are presently outsi e of the Cuban Army organization and this poSition may dampen their effectiveness in recruiting within the Army. Station reports on QUA ‘flict with A/2's evaluation of this man. While there is no evidence to verify that DUARTE is pro=-regime, there has been a recent report 6n him from AMLEO/3 which claims 4 ‘is an opportunist Who might work for the highest bidder caer Vik s rebuttal to these refiatks is that @ REE has assisted him in ' the past’ and when the chips were down, he continued to aid him in his underground activities. This still leaves a question mark next to the worth of 4 DUARTED which unfortunately can only be resolved by direct contact act between him and A/2. There are other security implications which should be discussed in this evaluation, Both A/2 and A/3 cannot bé considered truly se- curity cofiscious. While safehotised A/2 wroté a letter to a contact in Miami which was to be transmitted by his case officer. The letter gave aii indication that A/2 was séeking centacts in Havana arid convéyed the imprésSion that a trip was in the a@fing. —A/2 has written several other letters 5 ‘K/2 on an opération that would take them first to ae and then to Cuba. Once there they would go is « mand begin to make contacts. A/3 also stated that 2 a man named QUARTER would be one of their con= tacts. This loosé talk Coupled with A/3's attitude that KUBARK é6xists only to servé him makes him 4 marginal candi-= daté for this opération. However , if A/3 is exfiltrated “ithree-days after his entry into Cuba, the operation will “. gain, his usefulness and eliminate somé of the risk he presents. 3.)- The above evaluation stresses the operational and security weaknesses in this operation. In contrast to these weaknesses are the positive considerations of this mission. A/2 has the intelligence, competence, and confidence to approach and re- cruit two assets with the potential for developing anti--regime operations at a high level within the Cuban Army. The results ‘which these anti-regime activities can accomplish is a matter for conjecture but it appears that they carry potential. Nevertheless, if the operation continues, it will bear close watching. in terms of security and control for these factors will jeopardize the operation as well as KUBARK's position if not properly contained. IV. PHASE II . A. AMTRUNK PERSONNEL BA * Thy hier i: His father, now deceased, was a prominent individual in law and politics and was at one time a senator. A/27 himself _graduated from law school in Habana and was a practising lawyer. In 1959 he became legal adviser to Camilio Cienfuegos. ‘Following the disappearance of Cienfuegos in October 1959, A/27 began to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, In May 1961, at which time he'held the position of Under- Secretary of Public Works, he felt that his underground ‘activities. had come. to the attention of the government and he took refuge along with his wife in the Venezuelan Embassy. He was given safe conduct from the Embassy to PBPRIME in late. 1961. Subject is intelligent, articulate, and highly moti- vated. He has some experience in counter-revolutionary ‘activities and has demonstrated an excellent capacity for learning clandestine techniques. He has a very large ego, and aristocratic pride, is very sensitive, and is quick to take offense CwiS thank to state that he h of -KUBARK 2 a KUBARK agent and. ng for the overthrow of the present regime in his own country and that he will accept KUBARK aid and advice but will not accept KUBARK control.

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 | ‘ oo AMTRUNK Operation - Interim Working Draft, Dated 14 February 1977, with Attachments - 14-00000 AMTRUNK Operation INTERIM WORKING DRAFT ; 7 14 February 1977 1. It is possible that the AMTRUNK Operation might have been a political action operation run against the U.S.G./CIA. (See the separate memorandum on "Operations to Split the Castro Regime.") 2. In late 1962 or early 1963, pressure was exerted on CIA by Higher Authority (State Department and the White House) to consider a proposal for an on-island operation to split the CASTRO regime. The proposal was presented to Mr. HURWITCH, the State Department Cuban Coordinator, by Tad szuLC (AMCAPE-1) of the New York Times. On 6 February 1963, Albert C. DAVIES, (Lt. Col. on military detail to WH/4 - Cuba) met with SZULC at SZULC's residence, to discuss the plan. SZULC referred to it as the "Leonardo Plan." While at first hesitant, SZULC finally revealed that Dr. Nestor MORENO (AMICE- 275 was one of its prime originators. SZULC said that he first thought of bringing the plan to the attention of President KENNEDY, as he had had a standing invitation, since November 1961, for direct contact with President KENNEDY, Attorney General KENNEDY, or Mr. McGeorge BUNDY, on matters concerning Cuba. He decided against that approach, however, and instead determined to use the Cuban'Coordinating Group. SZULC later said that George VOLSKY (AMTRUNK-1) masterminded the plan, assisted by: MORENO. It was agreed that CIA representatives would meet with SZULC and the two Leonardo planners, MORENO and VOLSKY, in Washington. 14-0000 The follow-up meeting on 9 February (in a safehouse) was attended by HURWITCH, Tad SZULC, Jorge VOLSKY, Dr. Nestor MORENO, and David MORALES, Col. A. DAVIES and Alfonso RODRIGUEZ of the CIA. 3. A 11 February 1963 memorandun from RODRIGUEZ to the Chief, SAS, expressed definite interest in the operation with certain recommendations which included having JMWAVE Station put its operational mechanism into gear to have the Cuban personnel of. the operation (now called AMTRUNK) ready for infiltration by mid-March 1963. Following a review of the AMTRUNK Project, JMWAVE forwarded a lengthy dispatch to Head- quarters, dated 8 April 1963, which recommended that the operation be terminated soonest. Since it was a Headquarters originated operation, JMWAVE also requested Headquarters decision as to continuance or termination. A Headquarters cable to ‘JMWAVE on 10 April 1963 concurred that the AMTRUNK operation should be terminated for a number of reasons, including the fact that CIA could not at that time be certain that hostile elements were unaware of the plan. A 17 April 1963 cable from Headquarters to JMWAVE Station advised that SZULC had informed HURWITCH that JMWAVE had given VOLSKY responsibility to decide whether or not the operation was to continue. It seems that Headquarters had intended to use VOLSKY, with his concurrence, only as a funding channel for the AMTRUNK operation if the AMTRUNK principals were willing to proceed with the operation : independently. In any case, for some reason, CIA continued to 14-0000 support the operation. The two principals, MORENO (AMICE- 27) and Miguel A. DIAZ Isalgue (AMICE-14) claimed to have contact with high-level GOC officials. They completed four infiltration missions.to Cuba and were terminated in March 1964. 4. Early phases of the operation resulted in the on-island recruitment of Ramon Tomas GUIN Diaz (AMTRUNK-10), Modesto Orlando OROZCO Basulto (AMTRUNK-9), and Carlos PEDRAZA Aguilar (AMTRUNK-11). GUIN was arrested in February 1966. (CUBELA was arrested at the same time, separately.) OROZCO, after reportedly running scared, was exfiltrated and terminated in March 1964. He returned to Cuba in December 1964 on an indepen- dent exfiltration mission and apparently remained in Cuba. There is some speculation that he might have been G-2. His knowledge of the identity of internal AMTRUNK agents, caused a planned infiltration mission to be scrapped. PEDRAZA was arrested in December 1965, tried for alleged CIA activities and given a 30 year prison sentence. JMWAVE Station advised in March 1966 that four former AMTRUNK internal assets were arrested for counterrevolutionary activities during early 1966, in addition to CUBELA and GUIN, and that all of the principals of the AMTRUNK network active during 1963 and 1964 had been rolled up. The Cuban press reportedly identified DIAZ (AMICE-14) as the clandestine infiltree who recruited GUIN. . COMMENT: It appears that the opposition might have succeeded in obtaining CIA financial and material support for an operation which was controlled by the planners. They succeeded, it seems, in identifying, neutralizing, and exposing 14-00000 on-island anti-Castro forces, and tying up CIA time, money, and manpower for an operation of their own creation. Following are some reasons which might have contributed to its failure: . a. The controversial nature of the principal ‘initiators, Tad SZULC, Jorge VOLSKY and MORENO. The AMTRUNK operatives made it known that they were anti-U.S.G. and anti-CIA and accepted assistance only to accomplish their own purposes. They were not under CIA control. b. ‘SZULC, although reportedly not directly involved in the operation, was kept fully informed of its activities by MORENO and perhaps others. c. SZULC's direct contact with the White House, if true, placed him in a position to pass U.S. policy infor- mation on Cuba: to the opposition, (There is a note by Richard Helms on a 23 September 1963 cover sheet requesting Alfonso RODRIGUEZ to maintain periodic contact with SZULC on Cuban matters at Presidential request going back many months.) . d. RABEL (AMLEO-3) , who "defected" to the U.S. in 1962, was knowledgeable of on-island AMTRUNK targets. RABEL, following termination, returned to Cuba allegedly to bring out. his family, and never returned. There is a possibility that he was a CASTRO agent. e. CUBELA was knowledgeable of at least some of the AMTRUNK agents. GUIN (AMTRUNK-10) was a codefendant in the CUBELA trial. (Believe GUIN may have been given a stiffer sentence than CUBELA and may still be in prison.) €22 14-0000 ue . . - an Froeg ae Lode CUBELA was given a relatively light sentence, considering the magnitude of the crime. Immediately following Oa sentencing he functioned as a prison physician, and nN reportedly was driving a jeep unescorted, which is unusual treatment unless one is trusted by the regime. He report- edly is now practicing medicine as a private physician in Havana. f. The questionable activities and current where- abouts of AMTRUNK-9. We have learned of the other AMTRUNK ‘agents who were wrapped up but we have been unable to determine precisely where AMTRUNK-9 is. There is some indication that he might have been G-2. . g. There was overlap with other operations: the AMLILAC's, placing CUBELA cache, etc. NOTE: Cables cited in this paper, and other selected papers from the AMTRUNK Project, are readily available in the LAD/JFK Task Force office for review if needed. LAD/JFK Task Force/Chris Hopkins:rp 14-00000 14 February 1977 MEMORANDUM SUBJECT: Tadeusz (Tad) Witold SZULC (AMCAPE-1) (201-50539) 1. SZULC was born on 25 July 1926 in Warsaw, Poland. He arrived in Brazil from Lisbon on 3 August 1940, and came to the U.S. in October 1947 under sponsorship of U.S. Ambassador John C. WILEY, the husband of his mother's sister. He became a correspondent for the New York Times (NYT) in 1953, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1954 by a special Congressional bill. 2. SZULC has been under suspicion as a hostile foreign agent since 1948 when the FBI reported (apparently from a Mist source) that he was a Communist. He brought himself to the attention of CIA in August 1959 in Santiago, Chile by claiming (falsely) to be "cleared" and requesting contact with an Agency representative. This was the first of many such incidents in Latin America, and resulted in a warning to all Latin American Stations to beware of SZULC and his efforts to interview Agency personnel. It also resulted in continuing watch of his movements and activities because they represented a threat to the cover of Agency personnel. By 1960 his reputa- tion was so widespread that several different CIA officers called for an investigation that would clear up "once and for all" his suspected connections with a hostile intelligence service. He was in frequent contact with Communist Party leaders and functionaries throughout Latin America, constantly sought out and elicited information from U.S. Embassy officers, 14-0000 frequently mentioning the name of other CIA officers with whom he was acquainted. 3. Although the suspicions have increased, and SZULC's anti-Agency activities have become much more serious and blatant in the 1970's, it has not been possible to clear up any of the suspicions about his motives or his possible connections with a foreign intelligence service. There have been numerous reviews of his files and the interest in his activities has extended from the case officer level to the DCI. In fact, it is not possible to come to any clear conclusion about this man, and the notes below are simply illustrative of the kinds of things that keep the suspicions alive. It is important to note that SZULC's activities can be explained by the combination of his personality, ambition, and the demands on an investigative reporter for the NYT. He is an aggressive, insensitive, and persistent journalist with the family connections (Ambassador Wiley) and ability to develop the kinds of contacts appropriate to a successful correspondent for a paper like the NYT. 4. Nevertheless, there are elements throughout his entire career that are almost designed to arouse suspicion. For example, a BEG£ISH source in Rio de Janeiro (see Attachment A) reported that SZULC was "directed" by the Polish regime in Warsaw to seek employment in U.S. journalistic circles. This report runs like a thread throughout his file and is repeated and garbled in several versions over the years. The report 14-0000 has never been adequately explained and was apparently never by the @FifisH representative in Rio. This report and other questions that arose early in his reported in full to fGiiden career (his contacts with a cousin who was a Press Attache in the Polish Embassy in Rio) were, however, just the earliest elements that aroused suspicion. 5. Because he became so well-known to so many Agency officers, his name and reputation have become subject of discussion on many occasions. One senior operations officer stated in 1975 that a Soviet agent could not be more beneficial to the Soviets and the Communist cause than SZULC has been. Although he presented a generally anti-Communist view prior to quitting the NYT in 1972, it is noteworthy that he arranged extensive, favorable TV coverage of the Communist-dominated Ligas Campesinas in Northeast Brazil and that one of the most important anti-Castro operations, AMTRUNK, in which he was involved fromthe beginning, was disastrous for all participants. More indicative of his true beliefs, however, are the articles he has written since Watergate. They have become increasingly critical of the CIA and of the USG generally and have damaged U.S. image and prestige. 6. The notes below are somewhat random examples of elements in SZULC's file that bring him under suspicion. As mentioned above, they in no way point to a firm conclusion. For further information on SZULC during the period 1963 - 1964, see the Cl review prepared at Miami Station on Jorge VOLSKY in 1964. 14-00000 ScOneT a. The 1948 FBI report that SZULC was involved in supplying the Polish Legation in Rio with information from his personal contacts and from Ambassador John C. Wiley has been repeated in various versions throughout SZULC's file. The FBI has found similar allegations made by other sources who knew SZULC at that time. In addition, several sources have mentioned SZULC's relations with his cousin, Ignacy SACHS, who was the Press Attache in the Polish Embassy in 1947 and 1948, although there is no indication that SACHS had intelligence connections. b. SZULC's marriage to the daughter of the American manager of the English language newspaper in Rio de Janeiro, the Herald, lasted only until SZULC had permanent residence in the U.S. and appears to have been carried through for that purpose. c. By 1949 (SZULC was only 23) he had come to the attention of the Qid-S##€¥on) because of his dealings with the Polish Legation and because investigation revealed his father had some (apparently innocent) business dealings with Russians visiting Brazil from Mexico. d. In 1954, about a year after he was hired by the NYT, SZULC obtained a sensational story, by telephone, from a Communist leader in Guatemala. This launched his career with the NYT. e. In 1956 SZULC was investigating Brazilian nuclear policy for the NYT. Although a legitimate topic, it was somewhat unusual for him and the timing seems unusual for NYT interest. 1400000 + SECRET = ; f. In 1959, on a trip to Santiago, Chile, SZULC claimed to be "cleared" and requested an interview with an Agency representative. This was the first of numerous such requests. In addition, it was in about 1959 that he also began making a point of telling Agency personnel the names of other Agency officers he had identified. g. An article SZULC wrote on Cuba for the NYT in December 1959 was hailed as an antidote to the excessively . favorable reports of his colleague, Herbert MATTHEWS, but in fact his article was largely favorable to Fidel CASTRO and to CASTRO's plans for Cuba. It is only in comparison ; that with MATTHEWS blatantly pro-CASTRO articles / SZULC's piece/can -° be considered balanced. h. By September 1960, SZULC was in the forefront of those advocating action against CASTRO. (it was he who finally brought the Leonardo Plan to Washington in 1963. See AMTRUNK Operational paper). i. In April 1961, shortly after John F. KENNEDY was innaugurated, SZULC was transferred to Washington by the NYT. Although a reasonable transfer, it is noteworthy that in a very short time SZULC claimed that he had a standing invitation to go directly to the President, the Vice President, the Attorney General, McGeorge BUNDY and Robert HURWITCH on Cuban matters. 5 SECRET 14-00000 j. SZULC persistently sought a continuing contact with an Agency representative in Washington shortly after he arrived until it was granted in December 1962. The first contact was with Albert C. DAVIES (Lt. Col. on military detail to CIA - Cuba) , and was arranged at the behest of Colonel GROGAN, the Assistant to the Director, on SZULC's request. . , k. ‘In early 1963, at President KENNEDY's urging, 7 contact with SZULC was made into a formal relationship and was continued until October 1964. The meetings were used by SZULC to cross check his information from other sources, including various Cuban exiles and the Department of State. He became, by virtue of his contacts with the exile community dnd throughout Washington, one of the most knowledgeable people in the area of Cuban affairs, anti- CASTRO activities, and U.S. Government policy. (See CI study on Jorge VOLSKY for more information on this period.) 1. The Agency officer, Alfonso RODRIGUEZ, who main- tained official contact with SZULC in 1963 and 1964 said in July 1964: "The special friendship and mutual admiration society that has existed between Tad SZULC, Jorge VOLSKY, and Manuel RAY and the JURE is not something that is transparent or easily explained. This alliance may be something unholy and Machiavellian; I just do not know, but I can find no evidence to prove it." 14-00000 Oto ned m. Another officer, Seymour Young, wrote in 1965: "After reading and re-reading this man's various files, I began to feel that this man in his position would be an ideal ‘agent of influence’. It was noted that he is always in a crisis area and usually in advance of the crisis and writes articles which are more concerned with the Communist successes." n. In about August 1965, SZULC was sent to Madrid as the NYT representative for Spain and Portugal. He stayed overseas until December 1968. He was present in Prague during the Soviet invasion of August 1968 and in December he was expelled, apparently for being too inquisitive. However, the ast. Ge tt EwECS has remained suspicious of the circumstances of SZULC's expulsion and the details have never been clarified. (It is interesting that SZULC wrote articles reflecting the official CZECH line concerning the defection of General Jan SEJNA who was in the Czech Intelligence service.) o. SZULC was reported by an FBI source to have gone horseback riding with Boris V. YAROCHEVSKIY, a suspect KGB officer, in Washington in June or July 1971. SZULC's file reflects no regular contact with Bloc diplomats. p. In 1972 and 1973 SZULC covered Watergate extensively and demonstrated an extreme bias against the CIA. By " July 1972, SZULC's inquiries of the Department of State and his articles had taken on a distinctly anti-US Govern- ment tone. His coverage of guerrilla and terrorist groups 14-00000 aa 5 SEBRET was less sure than in earlier days and was frequently sensationalist and full of inaccuracies. (See, especially, article in NYT for 14 July 1972 on a terrorist Headquarters in Zurich and other wild statements.) q. Since 1974 SZULC's articles have been highly critical of the Agency and he has used the background information he gathered in the 1960's to attack the Agency and to criticize its operations. r. In May 1975 SZULC accused the Agency of rifling the files of U.S. Senators. This was only one of many irresponsible and false articles he wrote trying to dis- credit the Agency. One of the more spectacular efforts was a series in Esquire magazine, in which, among other things, he charged that the U.S. intelligence community had a hidden budget of $25 billion dollars and a network of 200,000 spies. oS s. In, Inside the Company: A CIA Diary, Philip AGEE credits SZULC's daughter, Nicole, for having "obtained vital research materials in New York and Washington, D.C." There is reason to believe, particularly in view of the extreme views Tad SZULC has manifested in the past two years, that he may have aided his daughter in her "research."

However, his most recent activities are entirely consonant with . the view that he has already served the Soviets well and can 8 14-0000 a SECRET end his career as an overt propagandist taking advantage of the current furor over the CIA to do the greatest possible . damage.

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 | SECRET .14 February 1977 MEMORANDUM SUBJECT: Nestor Antonio MORENO Lopez ((AMICE-27)| (201-312091) 1. MORENO was‘ born on 25 August 1921 in Havana, Cuba. His father was a Cuban Senator (1940-44) and the Cuban Minister of Public Works (1944). MORENO became a lawyer and continued to live in comfortable circumstances. He became involved in the anti-BATISTA movement, apparently in the late 1950's, and ‘ultimately in the 26th of July Movement. After the revolution, one of his clients was Camilo CIENFUEGOS. In Miami after defection, he was associated with the JURE. 2. MORENO's specific activities in the anti-BATISTA movement were not reported and apparently were unexceptional. _A point worth noting about his activities before defection is his acquaintance with Tad SZULC, at least by 1959, and with Jorge VOLSKY. MORENO's background as-.a lawyer did not prepare him for active revolutionary involvement. When he defected in April 1961, therefore, he associated with: anti-CASTRO exiles, particularly VOLSKY, but did not become actively. involved. He was assessed in 1963 as being unfriendly to CIA. 3. About February 1963 MORENO and Enrique CAYADO Ribera reportedly collaborated in the formulation of an operational plan to overthrow the Castro government. They discussed it with Jorge VOLSKY, who then passed it to Tad SZULC. VOLSKY and SZULC apparently conspired to have the plan presented to the "political authorities" (Robert HURWITCH and the KENNEDY Administration) in Washington in order to by-pass the dis- SECRET % 14-00000 SEGHET trusted "operational authorities" (the CIA). (VOLSKY originally took full credit for the plan, called "Leonardo Plan," which eventually became known as the AMTRUNK Operation.) 4. The Leonardo Plan was well thought-out and caught the fancy of the KENNEDY Administration. HURWITCH bought it to the CIA with the blessings of the Department of State. Thus, from the very beginning, SZULC, VOLSKY, and MORENO, each of whom had outside interests to some degree in conflict with AMTRUNK, were involved in AMTRUNK policy and planning meetings. Moreover, all three were to some degree antipathetic to the _ Agency for various reasons and were difficult or impossible to control. 5. MORENO's indiscretions were a serious problem that limited his effectiveness as a direct participant in the AMTRUNK Operation by arousing the concern of other participants. While the Station attempted to cut out VOLSKY and SZULC after the initial policy discussions in Washington, VOLSKY always remained involved to some degree and kept SZULC fully informed. Under the circumstances, the censure of MORENO for talking to SZULC was just an attempt to plug one of many leaks. The fact is that MORENO, SZULC, and VOLSKY believed they had an inside ' track in Washington because of their contacts there and all three disliked following Agency instructions that conflicted with their own diverse interests. However, because JMWAVE > Station and/AMICE-14 (Miguel A. DIAZ Isalgue)| objected to MORENO's continued involvement in the AMTRUNK Operation after learning of his free talk with SZULC and others, the Station SECRET SERET terminated MORENO's involvement in the sensitive aspects of AMTRUNK .in November 1963. 6. Since MORENO was one of the original authors of AMTRUNK and already disliked the Agency, one can imagine his - feelings at that juncture. He sulked, refused at first to take a position on the Rebel Army Radio Program, and caused problems in general. "By January 1964 MORENO was actually interferring in the AMTRUNK Operation (by giving demoralizing, conflicting information to AMTRUNK-9, for example)j and attempting to debrief returnees on behalf of VOLSKY and SZULC. MORENO was fired, therefore, by RABEL on{Station instructions,_] from the Rebel Army Radio Program in February 1964 and) termin- ated by the Station as of 5 March.l 7. [shorety after his termination, MORENO, using VOLSKY as an intermediary, approached Mr. G. Harvey SUMM with a proposal similar to the Leonardo Plan. The/COS met with SUMM on 1 April 1964 and advised him how to put off MORENO. ] . 8. In August or September 1964, MORENO left Miami and took a position as a Spanish- language professor in South Carolina. CONCLUSION: MORENO apparently was a sincere anti-CASTRO revolutionary, but his dislike for and distrust of the Agency, which was undoubtedly stimulated by SZULC and VOLKSY, made his involve- ment in AMTRUNK a lia@bility to the security of the operation. It appears that MORENO, like many Cubans of the upper middle 14-0000 BRET class, had little sense of security. It is obvious that he trusted SZULC and VOLSKY far beyond what normal prudence would dictate. He probably was not a CASTRO agent, but he did help leak operational details and general plans to people who helped to spread the information more widely and who, themselves, were not trustworthy.

An undercurrent of friction has recently developed between _ AMICE/14 and AMTRUNK/3 which manifested itself in a fistfight on 29 March. This was precipitated by AMTRUNK/3 who called AMICE/14 ! the Cuban term for a. homosexual, the ultimate insult to a Cuban. ' This in turn gives rise to the question whether AMICE/14, with a _ possible history of homosexual activity (see UFGA-8411), has made ’ such an ‘approach. to AMTRUNK/3. . D.

Andrew 8. PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from headquarters, was already at the training site when the team was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N. PEGGINS and Hobart J. VANDEBORN. PARMERS remained at’ the safesite until 16 March during which time he conducted training in clandestine. methods and techniques. This training included security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica- tions, agent spotting, selection, recruitment and Management, and operational planning and reporting. The training included - group discussion and participation in a series of ‘appropriate operational situations, several problems, and daily physical training. During this two:week period, either PEGGINS or VANDEBORN visited the safesite every day, spending an average of two or three hours with the group in operational dis- cussions and processing. During the week of 18 thru 23 March, ‘both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group, ‘debriefing them in detail on their operational contacts, workin out operational details of their infiltration, and continuing their training on an informal basis.

COVER AND COMMUNICATIONS 1. Cover A/2 will. be issued documentation claiming he is an employee of a local brewery in-Havana.

Both will, also be issued drivers licenses and additional ‘items such as immunization certificates, Cuban receipts, etc. ' The two men will also be outfitted with disguises. 2. Communications Primary communications will be established through an SW system, Both men will be given SW instruction and will be issued accommodation addresses in Miami. This instruction and these addresses in turn will be passed on to the recruited .assets in PBRUMEN for use as the operation develops. Pre- arranged signals will also be devised for use by the team via . telegram to indicate their progress and confirm their place : and time of exfiltration. Both members will also be given an OWVL system to provide them with quick instructions in case of an emergency. ce OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY EVALUATION EE EON 1. The operational aspects of Phase I portrays a mission which has considerable potential but also considerable risk. The area of infiltration is within five miles of a cruise missile site and its accompanying radar. .In addition boat patrols are * Known to work this portion of the coast at frequent intervals. z4 / Once: infiltrated the team will not have to travel far before heir first contact. However, A/3 is leary of Staying at his ther's farm) for any length of time and he does not want his wt Zather)to know of his presence in Cuba. For this reason the "farm will not be able to serve as a safehouse. A/2 plans on leaving the farm the same day lands. This presents the nf _problem of what to dé» ens ave On approach is to take A/3 14-00000 td Guanabo or Havana and safehouse him. This, however, may jeopardize the operation because A/3 lacks the maturity and patience necessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his busi- ‘ness. He may take advantage of his visit to Havana to under- take a clandestine assignment on his own. When A/2 and 3 . step ashore in Cuba, control will vanish. Fortunately A/2 -has .a sufficient resource of judgement to go about his busi- ness competently. Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication. For this reason an attempt will be made to steer A/3 towards developing assets around his (father's farm)with maritime reception capabilities. zy 2, .A/2, on the other hand, appears to have a sufficient -numbe: of supporting assets tg; provide for hissafety while in Havana. However, he has not sesi\Vvals) and UARTE) for over a year. In addition both men are presently outside of the Cuban Army -organization and this position may dampen their e ctiveness in recruiting. within the Army. ; Station reports o DUARTE) con- flict with A/2's evaluation ofthis man. While there is no evidence to verify that ARTE {is pro-regime, thexe Mta]is E ete a recent report on him from AM /3 which claims (DUARTE]is an opportunist who might work for th tae eS h bidder .ofA/2's ’ rebuttal to these remarks is that [DuARTE) ks assisted him in "the past and when the chips wer wn he continued to aid him in his underground activities.o6This still leaves a question mark next to the worth of( DUARTE Which unfortunately can only be resolved by direct. contact between him ‘and A/2, There are _ other security implications which should be discussed in this “ : evaluation. Both A/2 and A/3 cannot be considered truly se- a oo" curity conscious, While safehoused A/2 wrote a letter to a ‘contact in- Miami which was to be transmitted by his case officer. The letter gave an indication that A/2 was seeking . contacts in Havana and conveyed the impression that a trip was in the dfing. A/2 has written several other letters not seen by his C Os which might have given the same impres- sion._A on the other hand tal quite freely abo q first to Miami and chee to Cuba. Once there they would go to his father's farm a d_ begin to make contacts. A/3 also stated ‘that a man named (DUARTE) ould be one of their con- tacts. This loose talk Goupléd with A/3's attitude that KUBARK exists only to serve him makes him a Marginal candi- _ ,date for this operation. However, if A/3 is exfiltrated oe * ..three-days after his entry into Cuba, the operation will . ‘. gain his usefulness and eliminate some of the risk he presents, — . oe 14-0000 -Q- 3.- The above evaluation stresses the operational and security weeknesses in this operation. In contrast to these weaknesses are the positive considerations of this mission. A/2 has the intelligence, competence, and confidence to approach and re- cruit two assets with the potential for developing anti-regime ' operations. at a high level within the Cuban Army. The results Iv. ‘which these anti-regime activities can accomplish is a matter for conjecture but it appears that they carry potential. Nevertheless, if the operation continues, it will bear close watching in terms of security and control for these factors will jeopardize the operation as well as KUBARK's position if not properly contained.

His father, now deceased, was a prominent individual in law and politics and was at one time a senator. A/27 himself - graduated from law school in Habana and was a practising lawyer. In 1959 he became legal adviser to Camilio Cienfuegos. ‘Following the disappearance of Cienfuegos in October 1959, 4/27 began to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. In May 1961, at which time he held the position of Under- Secretary of Public Works, he felt that his underground ‘activities. had come to the attention of the government and he took refuge along with his wife in the Venezuelan Embassy. He was given safe conduct from the Embassy to PBPRIME in late 1961. Subject is intelligent, articulate, and highly moti- vated. He -has some experience in: counter-revolutionary activities and has demonstrated an excellent capacity for learning clandestine techniques.

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 . s oe MEMORANDUM SUBJECT: Jose Ricardo RABEL Nunez/ (AMLEO-3) (201-249386) 1. Born 7 April 1922 in Havana, Cuba, the son of a native-born American citizen, RABEL was brought up in comfor- table circumstances. He attended high school in Cuba, com- pleted the last year in New Orleans, Louisiana, and entered Tulane University in September 1938. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in December 1940 and eventually saw combat in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria. After discharge in December 1945, RABEL returned to Cuba to attend the University of Havana and this began a life of job changes, moving back and forth between the U.S. and Cuba, and, in general, rootless living. 2. RABEL's background reads like that of a man with no allegiances.or loyalties and no particular goals. Viewed in retrospect, his career presents a picture of unreliability. It is probable that RABEL's rootiessness and apparent ; unreliability applied both to his relations with CASTRO and to ’ those with the Agency. It is quite possible, therefore, that he not only served the Agency in a superficial way but that he did the same for CASTRO at various times when it suited his purposes. Without postulating this sort of dual role (one which fits very well with his previous life) it is almost impossible to explain some of the reasonably good things he did for the Agency and the quite certain allegations that he was a CASTRO agent. This explanation is not fully satis- factory, but it does explain his career better than the charge 14-0000 “ SECRET that he was a CASTRO agent from the beginning. The question that must remain unanswered is whether he betrayed the AMTRUNK Operation. He was not arrested until September 1965 (when AMTRUNK had already run its course) but it appears quite certain that he cooperated with the DSE after his arrest and while he was in prison. . 3. RABEL joined in the clandestine activities against BATISTA in March 1952, first amongst the exiles in the U.S. and then after late 1952 from inside Cuba. He joined the Cuban armed forces to further his plotting and was assigned to the Cuban General Staff. He was the Cuban liaison officer with the U.S. Army mission in Cuba from November 1954 until April 1956. During his entire period in the Cuban arny, RABEL was involved with dissident Army elements; when they attempted a coup in April 1956, RABEL was arrested. He was released shortly thereafter, worked in the chicken business for a year and then returned to the U.S: and worked with one of his brothers (Luis RABEL Nunez). In October 1957 he returned to: Cuba and became involved with the 26th of July Movement but had to leave a year later when he was brought to the attention of the BATISTA forces because of a bomb explosion. He smuggled weapons to Camilo Cienfuegos for about a year and then in October 1958 he joined the Cienfuegos group. Shortly after the CASTRO victory, CASTRO called upon RABEL to set up a Cuban Marine Corps, a job he held until February 1960, at which time he was appointed Chief of Viviendas Campesinas. 2 SECRET SECRET He held this job until he defected to the U.S. in December © 1962. It is worth noting that he rarely pursued one activity in one place for more than a year at a time from 1945 to 1962. 4. -RABEL gave Alfonso RODRIGUEZ the following reasons for his defection: a. Communist pressure, hounding, and the basic enmity of the Communist Party toward him. (This appears very reasonable in view of his service in the U.S. Army : and training in some aspects of intelligence, such as prisoner interrogation. In addition, his schooling in the U.S. and the reasonable economic circumstances would | not have been recommendations from the Communist point of view.) b. Strong backing by Fidel which protected him from more serious attacks from the Party. (This, too, seems entirely reasonable. His family farm was near the farm Fidel's father managed and RABEL and Fidel had known each other as children. In addition, RABEL's long involvement in the anti-BATISTA movement and with Camilo Cienfuegos were probably in his favor in CASTRO's view.) c. An obligation to protect the non-Communists in his department, which prevented his earlier defection, and uncertainty of his reception in the U.S. (In view of the number of defections from RABEL's department, there were, in fact, people to protect. Since RABEL had served in the U.S. Army, and probably felt the U.S. was his second seGReT 14-0000 SECRET country, he could well have had questions about his reception after serving in the CASTRO government.) d. His resentment against the confining nature of a Communist State. (Since he never stayed in one place more than a short time in his entire life, to have been restricted to Cuba must have seemed a punishment.) S. RABEL was used [to pitch DgemeeMartar: FRAYDE Barrae in Paris in Guly 1963, ana [to check out leads for the AMTRUNK Operation. One of his leads led to the recruitment of AMTRUNK-10. Later,in early 1964, RABEL was leader of the Rebel Army Group supported by the American Legion in Miami and was involved in the Rebel Army Radio program. 6. There is no specific evidence (except the accusations below) that RABEL was involved in a suspicious way with the CASTRO regime during this period, but his desire to exfiltrate his wife and children was a constant source of difficulty between him and the Station. This problem led to his eventual termination in July 1964 and to a great deal of resentment on his part. He conspired constantly, from mid-1963 until his capture in Cuba in September 1965, to get into Cuba to exfiltrate his wife and children. 7. RABEL was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment but was set free in July or August 1967, which is a strong indication that the charges that he worked for the DSE while in prison were true. Moreover, there is some indication that he may have attempted a provocation at Cuban behest immediately after his capture. There are two firm accusations that RABEL was a 4 SEEK: | 14-00000 Cuban agent as early as July 1963 (which would have been when he was screening names for the AMTRUNK Operation), /one from LITA IL=93 and the other from Fernando REY reported by vastoucn-1] As mentioned above, these charges could well be true; yet RABEL could have fulfilled his duties for CASTRO superficially, for his own purposes, and not necessarily have compromised his work with the Agency until he was captured. The difficulties he had in exfiltrating his wife could have been, partially, punishment by CASTRO for not fulfilling his duties as an agent; otherwise, had his work in the U.S. been valuable, CASTRO could have facilitated the exfiltration of RABEL's wife so that RABEL could continue his work as an agent undisturbed.
