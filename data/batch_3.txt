This memorandum is for your information only. 2. On 7 May 1973" we were advised by Station WH/Miami that. “two employees of a Station WH/Mioni proprietary hadstold the tation that one Rene VIERA Gonzalez, a Cuban exile ‘journalist who writes for Diario Las Americas and owns. the Westch nester Mali Bookstore in Miami received a call in early May’ from one ENU GOTTLIEB who said he worked for the Times in Washington. _._ {GOTTLIEB is believed to be Sanford GOTTLTES, 11102 Brandywine St., Kensington, Md. who was formerly an “employee of the ‘ National Committee on Sane Nuclear Policy". -A pretext call to the Washington bureau of the New York Times verified. that one "Sandy" Gottlieb was employed there.) GOTTLIEB asked VIERA | ‘what people in Miami were saying about the Watergate’ case and what participation the Cubans had in it. He specifically asked about the activities of Reinaldo PICO (former 2506 _ Brigade member), Orlando PIEDRA (former Chief of Cuban Bureau . ‘of Investigation in Batista Government), and Rolando MASFERRER . (former Cuban Senator and self-admitted former Communist). He also asked if ITT had an office in Miami, whether Joaquin SANJENIS Perdoma (former Chief of a WH/Miami proprietary who was amicably terminated in 1972) and Juan A. PAULA (former WH/Miami proprietary employee and former Controller of ; Revolutionary Democratic Front-FRD-and currently employed by an OGC proprietary) were still in the Miami area. He. was also interested in Edgardo BUTITARI, a Cuban born in Hest Tampa, ‘Florida, a former Cuban Congressman and Minister of Commerce who is reportedly associated with Mr, Charles "Bebe" REBOZO. cording to GOTTLIEB, BUTTARI was appointed as “political chief in “the Re publican Party", #ABOY 14-00000 : Economic Planning and Budget, OAS? The conversation was 3. GOTTLIES apparently has current. information on the activities of the persens-he mentioned; for example, he knew that Juan A. PAULA was involved in the jewelry business (PAULA and Antonio Felix GENOVA Corzo, a WH/Miami proprietary © employee recently purchased a jewelry business) and‘he knew that Reinaldo PICO had resided in Venezuela and had racentiy returned to the United States. The phone conversation lasted. about 45 minutes and GOTTLIEB told VIERA that ‘af he. cane to Miami they would have lunch together. 4. “VIERA ‘dees not know GOTTLIEB but talked to him because GOTTLIES said he was recommended by Ernesto RETANCOURT who pas resided in the Washington area for more than ten years. NCOURD was a Former Agency asset and is currently Chief (of | initially in English but continued in Spanish. VIERA said he _ provided no information to GOTTLIEB on the basis that he is a Cuban exile and did not want to get involved in internal U.S. ‘affairs. We do not know why GOTTLIEB was interested in Joaquin. SANJENIS or Juan A. PAULA. (Attached are Summary biographies. OF persons of interest to GOTTLIEB.) ; 8, On 7 May 1973 Qarvin L.

EVANS said that (ckE! and could possibly be linked. to. NORTHWEST HANAGEUEND but the trail would end there. He - feels that either proprietary could only be linked to the Agency by innvendo. {He did say that Howard HUNT was aware of eTUAD when he served as C/CA/EUR.)

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 | OLC 74-0179 . 4 February 1974 MEMORANDUM FOR .THE RECORD SUBJECT: “Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities - : _ Testimony of 4 February 1974 _ l. This, the first day of hearings involving “Agency witnesses to testify under oath in executive session with Vice Chairman Howard Baker presiding, was held in S. 1418, Dirksen Office Building. Although scheduled ' to commence at 0930 hours, Senator Baker did not show up to swear in the oe ' witnesses until 1025 hours at which time he administered the oath to Mary McGillen, Robert Ritchie, Martin Lukoskie, and Erich Isenstead and then left. . 2. Background: a. Asa result of previous sessions with Senator Baker and his counsel the following Agency witnesses were scheduled; Mary McGillen, Robert Ritchie, Martin Lukoskie, Erich _Isenstead, James Angleton, Richard A. Krueger, Steven Greenwood, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, Thomas Karamessines, Frank O'Malley, and Jacob Esterline. b. Those witnesses who were able to assemble were met as a group on Saturday, 2 February, with Mr. Lansdale, Office of General Counsel, and myself meeting each one individually. It was pointed out to all that: (1) Their appearance before the Committee was voluntary; the Agency was not directing them to appear, but, of course, the Committee had the power of subpoena. : ” Signer: Parttsy 14-00000 (2) They had the right to a private counsel and that Mr. Lansdale and I would sit in with them during the session and that our principal role would be. to. assure that the questioning did not get into sensitive areas unrelated to 'Watergate."' ec. Early in the hearing of 4 February 1974 it became clear that the Committee could in no way handle the five witnesses scheduled for the day, and that the Committee counsels had not had sufficient time to. absorb the voluminous written material that we had provided them earlier in the week. As a result, with the agreement of Committee counsel we unplugged for now Messrs. Isenstead, Angleton, and O'Malley. Also, following the day's testimony which ended . in the late afternoon, I stayed on into the evening to review all of the material that we had provided to the counsels to make sure that they would make better use of the time of all involved. : - 3. Presession Agreements: ke , : Prior to the hearings Thompson agreed: a. To the security arrangements which I outlined : (see attachment). . be To treat the testimony as exhibits under the 1 February 1974 understanding reached with Senator Baker. : c. That he thought it would be all right for us to have a copy of the transcript, but he didn't want us to show it to . scheduled witnesses, (This is a fairly remote possibility because of the delay in getting transcripts. ) 4. Mary Louise McGillen: . (Saturday Miss McGillen had mentioned that she had hada | roommate who somehow knew Marchetti and that the former roommate had told her the Committee might be interested in talking to her, feeling that she had information relating to McCord's employment in the Agency. )} consent in Armee eh enact nemesis 14-00000 Miss McGillen testified from 1025 hours until 1040 hours and her testimony — was completely uneventful. She identified Mr. Hollis Whitaker. Also, her uncertainty over whether McCord retired in 1970 or 1971 raised.a possibility that she had seen McCord in Agency Headquarters in 1971 after McCord had retired, but eventually it was clarified that she had seen McCord before his retirement and not after it. 5. Robert Ritchie: Mr. Ritchie testified from 1040 hours until 1235 hours, with Thompson questioning Ritchie for about 65 minutes, Ritchie acquitted himself extremely well and there were no surprises in his testimony. . a. ‘Liebengood brought out the sudden TDY to Head- quarters from Miami following the Watergate incident. b. Some confusion arose because Ritchie was not sure ‘of the date he took over Martinez, he thought it might have been some time in March 1972, when in fact it was late in “April. c. It is obvious that the counsels have some conflicting testimony concerning the discovery of Martinez' car in the Miami airport following the. arrests in June 1972, 6. Martin Lukoskie: During Mr. Lukoskie! s testimony, which commenced at 1300 hours, I moved to go off the record a number of times on the following points: a. Thompson wanted to know who we dealt with in - \Genéral Foods to lay on cover arrangements. I told him ° we were getting into unchartered waters because J didn't know where his questioning was going to end up. He said his interest was to find out the names of the individuals and companies with which CIA had a relationship in Mexico . over the last ten years. I requested that he rephrase his 14-00000 question so that we could respond only with respect to the . _ particular companies or individuals in which he was. interested, As. a concession, he cut down the period from the last ten years a 7 _to "since 1971" and I said we would note his request. b. Thompson asked about CIA relationships with ‘the Mormon church, the Summa Corporation, or the Hughes Tool Company. ' (Thompson said he had specific information that we had something with the Mormon church.) 1 suggested that if he is interested in. ‘whether the Agency had any relationship with these three institutions -in' connection with CIA's relationship with the Mullen Company; he rephrase the question. Thompson refused to do this and I said we would note his request, : : uo: oe c. Thompson wanted a full explanation of the "WH flap." I told ‘Thompson this involved a sensitive and active situation _ which had been explained to Senator Baker and that Lukoskie.. was not an. Agency witness in this respect, but we would note his interest and see what could be provided. (I believe Thompson has already been fully exposed to the 'WH flap'' in an executive © hearing with Bennett during which Baker asked if Bennett knew what the WH flap was all about. Baker later told me that Bennett did know, and explained it to Baker. I assumed that Bennett may have gotten this information fromVJim E Everett}) Thompson observed the parallel which exists between the position of CIA with respect to the "WH flap" and the White House with respect to issues it did not wish to be explored .by the Attorney General in connection with the activities of the Plumbers (an observation I have been expecting for some time, “but this is the first time it © has been presented directly. ) Mr. Lukoskie! s testimony was excellent with no surprises and generally Paraieied that given to Senator Baker in the Senator’ s office on 11 December a. Concerning any general logs that CCS maintains on contacts with cover firms, Lukoskie explained that internal procedures had changed some time in December 1972 on the © information to be maintained in the logs. To assure his responsiveness to a specific question, I refreshed Lukoskie's. 14-00000 . memory on an entry in a CCS log on a call in June 1972 between the Agency and the Mullen Company in which it was. not clear either who initiated the call or who was contacted in the Mallen Company: . - Follow up: Provide any extant memorandum reflecting the change in information to be covered in the CCS log. © b. In response to counsel's questions, Lukoskie said he had no knowledge of (1) a Greenspun memorandum, (2) a- . Mr. Waite (sp?) of General Foods, and (3) Mr. Hemlick (sp?) _ of ANA (Association of National Advertisers). - Cc. The counsels focused in on the meetings between . Mr. Hunt and Messrs. Cord Meyer and Tom Karamessines, : ‘de In characterizing Mr. Bennett as an individual in "whom he did not have a great deal of trust, as contrasted with Mr. Mullen, Lukoskie mentioned Bennett's. suggestion | _ that Lukoskie would be well taken care of if he could assist in getting unfavorable information on Mr. ‘Maheu. . 7.. Following the hearings, I stayed on with the counsel and we reviewed late into the evening the voluminous material previously provided by the Agency to assure that they could make more effective use of the time of all involved and hopefully to get to the bottom of whatever is troubling them. During the session I made it clear that I was puzzled by their gues - tioning during the day since it was apparent that they had not yet absorbed ' the information we had already provided and which we think satisfactorily _answers the questions they had raised. Restating a point that I had made previously, I said that while I did not personally believe so, their investi- gation had the appearance of a fishing expedition and that if they continued it would be unavoidable that we would have to disclose more and more sensitive information which had no bearing on the case and which I assumed 14-00000 they had no desire to obtain, I said that I felt that serious consideration should be given to either advising Mr. Colby about the particulars, or if Poe that was not satisfactory, to at least advise our oversight Committee _ ! . chairmen and ask them to investigate whatever serious leads: had been ‘ developed in the secure environment structured for the oversight of ‘sensitive CIA matters.. Mr. Thompson admitted this suggestion had some © merit. : ; : mo es 7 LYLE L.

DDCI The DDCI attended this week's staff meeting. He spoke of his appreciation of being able to work directly with the Operations Directorate, an organization which he has known from the field. He said that when he was first offered the nomination of the post of Deputy Director, he thought of the Agency primarily in terms of his perceptions of this Directorate. He knew that its officers worked long hours, developed excellent contacts and produced top-flight reports working always with a strong sense of dedication. He is planning to have a series of briefings which will further acquaint him with the activities of the Directorate. Meanwhile he reaffirmed that he had an open door to persons who had problems or issues that they wished to bring directly to his attention. On his first day on duty, Mr. Carlucci was thrown in direct confrontation.with the Department over the State/ CIA Treaty. While the Department has expressed very strong emotion concerning this Treaty, the Deputy Director stands by the position that he expressed during his confirmation hearings. When asked by one Senator about the State/CIA relations, he said that he felt this relationship had‘been . codified to the extent that this was possible and that it was now a matter for Ambassadors and Chiefs of Station to work out their own individual arrangements. He hopes that we will be able to find some way of diffusing this issue so that we may proceed to other more substantive issues such as internal reporting responsibilities, communications, and cover. ' Specific cover problems were briefly discussed. The DDO promised to deliver to the DDCI a new inventory of those issues and situations where the Divisions are APPROVED FOR RELEASE 1933 OR HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM E2 IMPDET yor CL BY 008284 encountering problems that they or the DDO had been unable to resolve with the Department. The DDCI agreed to take a look at this catalog of cover problems and asked that a special paper on cover problems in Africa be forwarded to hin. Mr. Carlucci spoke of the interest Congress has in imposing Hughes/Ryan type procedures on sensitive intelligence operations as well as covert action. He had pointed out two problem areas to the Senate Committee, i.e., the difficulty of defining what is a sensitive operation and the problems involved in providing sufficient background and detail to permit the SSCI to make informed judgments on individual operations. 2. Responses to Dr. Brzezinski's Letter . While Dr. Brzezinski has not replied to the letter sent earlier to him this month proposing the 32 key countries on which we would prepare new political reporting plans, we are working on the presumption that this list is acceptable to him, It is planned that we will include sensitive operational details in a separate annex. The plan will be coordinated with NFAC and the Department and then forwarded with the annex to Dr. Brzezinski. 3. Memoranda Addressed to DCI and DDCI t Memoranda addressed to the DCI and DDCI concerning their appointments with Ambassadors and Chiefs of Station should be in their offices at least three days prior to the scheduled appointment. 4. Reorganization of the Operations Directorate The DDO presented his tentative plan for the reorganization ‘of the.Operations Directorate which he will discuss with the Director within a week. oe SOAFIDENTIAL-EVES OHLY 21 FEB 1978 fKenney, JohnH: > = ssi«s:Ct*« RY COS /AnKard>, _ February 1978 —- EXTENSION EXTEND TO | jogino, Jack> (NE) COS7CaTEREO > August 1979 flwetten, Thomas AS. =...

HE SAID HE WAS AWARE BEFORE THE HIJACKING WAS PLANNED THAT THERE WERE REPORTS THAT THE 508 THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE WESTERN AIRLINES HIJACKING HAD BEEN RETURNED, BUT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE REPORT SINCE HE (7-27 PAGE 3 (LGIERS) 1341 SECRET ALSO AWARE THAT THE HIJACKERS IN THAT CASE WERE FREE IN ALGIERS. ALSO, MCNAIR REASONED THAT SUCH A LARGE SUM WOULD OVERRIDE ALGERIAN POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THEIR DECISION - QN THE MONEYS DISPOSAL. 6. THE RECENT RAID ON THE BPP HEADQUARTERS BY ALGERIAN " AUTHORITIES WAS TRIGGERED BY CLEAVER’S OPEN LETTER TO PRESI- ‘DENT BOUMED I ENE DEMANDING RETURN OF THE HIJACK . MONEY. CLEAVER*®S LETTER WAS WRITTEN WITHOUT THE APPROVAL _ OF THE REST OF THE BPP MEMBERS IN ALGERIA AND CAUSED A MAJOR SPLIT IN THE PARTY. 7» MCNAIR APPEARED AT EASE IN FLANIK®S OFFICE AND QUITE TALKATIVE, ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION CENTERED ON HIS TRIP TO ALGIERS. HE APPARENTLY SURPRISED TO FIND — ALGERIA SUCH AN ADVANCED COUNTRY. HE HAS NO DOCUMENTATION -. EXCEPT AN AMERICAN DRIVER'S LICENSE AND WHEN ASIED IF HE .WISHED TO APPLY FOR A US PPT, HE REPLIED THAT “WE HAVE No WHERE TO GO, SO I GUESS NOT.” MCNAIR EXPECTED TO RETURN LNFALL NEXT FEW DAYS TO SEE WHAT PROGRESS FLANIK HAS MADE ON PPT APPLICATIONS. 8.
