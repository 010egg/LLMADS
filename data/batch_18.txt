SUBJECT: Court Foster Wood [Michael Weimer Stratton} has recently advised that Court £ Foster Wood was a relatively close high school friend of Stratton): Virginia, during 1957 to 1959. _during mutual attendance at 3. [Stratton High School, Falls Churéh, S tratton] described Wood as an ad no particular ‘problems with the exception that there were domestic difficulties between the father and mother of Wood. {St#atton]became acquainted with the parents of Wood and made occasional visits to their home during the above period of time. The father of Wood, Foster Wood, is an attorney who was then living in Falls Church. Some time ago the father and mother of Court Wood split up and Court Wood and father moved into an apartment on Columbia Road, Washington, D.C. . (SePatton) advised that after graduation from high school in June 1959 he lost any close contact with Wood who then started to attend George Mason College, where he seemed to have an interest in philosophy.$ Stratton\ started to attend a_ military school and Wood expressed extreme Opposition to military schools. > (Stvactoa married in 1960, which also helped to nove [Stratton]} somewhat out“of the social circle of Wood. TStractog) bet feved that for approximately a year, during 1959 to 1960, he did not actually see Wood but advised that after this period.in which he did not see Wood he has had a number of contacts with Wood, many of which occurred during mutual attendance at the University of Virginia Extension School (night school) in early 1961. On one occasion {Stratton} attended a party at the apartment occupied by Wood and ‘father St the invitation of Wood, and on. this occasion came into contact with the "new set of friends" of Court Wood, whom [Stratton] $ described as being "beatnik_types." Girls in. attendance at the party, according to[ Stratton}, appeared to be of the "street pickup" type. : . 3 . After the above party Wood occasionally ‘telephoned [Strattoal> and about Christmas 1960 Wood called and stated that he was going to Cuba_under the auspices of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Stratton) called on Wood after the return of Wood from Cuba and at that time Wood lauded Castro very highly. The father of Wood was “also present and|StrattonPobtained the impression that the father was also in sympathy wit Castro. S{Stratton) recalled that he again, at a later date, had visited the Wood apartment, this being an occasion when Wood had been visiting somewhere in Falls Church and contacted [Stratton] to ask Stratton }to take Wood home.

The DD/P made a substantial argument in favor of leaving all of TSD under his control in order to insure close and intimate relations with the operating units. Further, an argument of almost overwhelming proportions indicated that the DD/R already had some very major responsibilities without taking on the diverse and generally unrelated responsibilities of TSD, € Other Research and Development eee evelopment After considerable additional study it was decided to transfer all ELINT to DD/R, except for the direct command of certain field units which under all circumstances should be left under the station chiefs. Research and development in suppoxt of NPIC would fall under DD/R for those very advanced items, but not for current production require- ments. -8.- 14-00000 Part 0 Coordination The staff of the Assistant for Coordination has continued to work on the same basis as formerly and continues to be constituted of assignees from other agencies, There appears to be progress in , achieving closer inter-agency coordination, but whether this is due to the work of the Coordination Staff or to the DCI's personal interest in this subject would be hard to determine, Princeton Consultants to ONE. This group has been continued. National Photographic Interpretation Center The Executive Director has personally kept under review the work- load of NPIC. NPIC is recruiting in anticipation of an increased work- load. Caliber of Personnel The new DD/I is cognizant of this problem and is taking steps to improve the caliber of the personnel. .. Merger of ONE and OCI It has been decided not to merge these offices. Preparation and Dissemination of Memoranda Too many uncoordinated memoranda are still being circulated. The practice of asking other departments to prepare memoranda has not beén adopted.

DD/R's Operational Responsibilities It has been firmly established that DD/R will operate those pro- jecta which he develops, We believe that DD/R has implemented some of the principles in the special annex of the Working Group report, 14-0000 ero Organization and Activities of the Intelligence Communit eco bommunity National Indications Center - Watch Committee General Carter, the new Chairman of the Watch Committee, has made a thorough review of its activities and NIC operations, Steps have been taken to see that NIC is properly manned with the right personnel, and the Department, of State is being constantly reminded of Its obligations in this regard. We also believe that the methods of CIA Relations with the Department of State ne —Spartment of State Sifice the is suance of the.

The Audit Staff is removed from the DD/S area and placed under the Inspectcr General. The Compirotle: is removed from the DD/3 area, given greatly expanded responsibilities, anu will report directly to the DcI/ DDCI's ofiice. The General Counsel's office is removed from under the DD/S, will resume responsibility for Congressional relations, and will report directly to the DCI/DDCI's office. The Office of Cperations is disbanded. Contact Division to DD/P as nucleus for Domestic Division. Foreign Documents Division to be combined with OCR Library. Foreign Broadcast Information Division to be independent unit reporting directly to DD/I. Position of Assistant DD/P for Covert Action abolished. Assistant DD/P for Paramilitary and Air Support Operations created. Central Support Staff under DD/P created. This will draw together such support as personnel, logistics and budget and will also take over technical support from those operating units of TSD which remain in the DD/P, e.g., secret writing, audio operations, etc. The Central Support Staff will also absorb the present Operational Services Staff and certain other activities. A Special Task Force is created for such operations of a magnitude that transcends the capabilities of one division. The International Organizations Division and Covert Action Staff are combined, putting together our largest activities in this field. A Domestic Division is created. This will absorb as its nucleus Contact Division of CO from the DD/I, the Commercial Staff, the Air Proprietary Branch irom DPD, ultimately the management of CAT from the DD/S, and those aspects of cover which involve contacts with the U.S. business community. A Deputy Director for Research is created. This or ganization will take over the Office of Scientific Intelligence from the DD/I, Special Projects ...:m DPD, all research and development from TSD, and other research and development activities currently located in various units of the Agency such as the Office of Communications, NPIC, etc. SEZ RET . - 14-00000 fom March 29, 1962 MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD SUBJECT: Notes on discussions between myself, Carter, Kirkpatrick Coyne and Schuyler in review of report of the Kirkpatrick Committee Following recommendations call for further consideration and possible modification. : I.

This matter considered of greatest importance. IV. Elements of DD/R 1. It should be recognized that Deputy Director for Research is a cover and this‘ office not necessarily confined to research but should be tag ked with operationed responaibi- lities. Also most important project under DD/R is OXCART, therefore DD/R must be restrained from taking on collateral activities so fast that OXCART will suffer. The DD/R responsibilities will cover all phases of Agency responsibility and activity in NRO which may or may not include the actuai operation of CXCART. It will include intelligence input into OXCART and CORONA and SAMOS planning, irrespective of where operations rest. 2. Location of OSI should be resolved. : 3. Interrelationship between DD/R and DD/P to provide staff support and particularly the Cl production should be established by directive of Deputy DCI, 14-00000 4. With resrect to pate 23, certain operational résponaibi. ities should pass from DO/2 to DD/P upon completion of research and development; however a study should be made to determine whether the many fully intesrated operational activities such as OX CART and some fully integrated ELINT operations should not be permanently under DD/R who is to have both Operational and research and development responsibilities. Considerations of OXCART OS OL VAG ARL 1. Responsibility for all phases of OXCART are to follow the direct supervision of Sec/Def and DCI by agreement with the OD, Charyk as AR/Sec.Def., will be executive head of NRO, DD/R will be his Deputy and by assignment will be responsible for all phases of OXCART. 2. Details of operations, as contrasted to R&D, will be worked out at a later date. : 3. NSC directive agreed OXCART tasks are responsibility of Special Group and question of augmentation is a matter for Special Group, not CIA, to decide. | . “he 4. DD/R should be charged with the responsibility of mobilizing and utilizing all necessary resources of DD/I, DD/P and DD/S and General Counsel in performance of DD/R's assigned respon- sibility as Deputy Director NRO and manager of OXCART project. 5. Question of uae of Air Force officers versus civilians must be decided by higher authority, likewlse the question of Operational responsibility between that of CLA or DD/R or personnel secanded from the Air Force versus direct Air Force operation must be decided by DCI and Sec/Def. and the President after careful consideration of all issues and problems relating to this matter. , 6. Because of imminence of commencement of test flights immediate careful attention should be given to all aspects of the cover story az certain information concerning the plane will become known when it ig observed in FAA (hat other radar V.

White House briefings should continue; a substitute for Mr. Amory should be arranged until a more adequate arrangement is provided; Daily briefings of Bundy, Clifton and Taylor and an occasional briefing of the President by DCI should suffice. JOHN A, McCONE Director 14-00000 6 April 1962 MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence SUBJECT : Final Report of Working Group on Organization and Activities 1. Ihave the honor to present herewith the final report of the working group which you established in January to consult with you and advise on the organization and activities of the Central Intelligence — Agency, and of its relationship with other agencies in the intelligence community. This report reflects the views of the working group and is divided into two parts. The first part deals primarily with the organiza- tion of the Central Intelligence Agency and reflects the unanimous views of the working group. The second part contains comments and recom- mendations on areas dealing with the work of the Ceatral Intelligence Agency and activities of the intolligence community in which the working group was either unable to agree or felt that considerably more study was needed before action was taken, . : 2. For the record I would note that the working group held its first session on January 3 and met on 35 different days between that date and its final session with you on March 28, During its work the group had approximately 100 briefings. Most of these briefings dealt with the organization and activities oi the Central Intelligence Agency, but also included a full day spent with the Department of State in addition to several briefings on State Department activities and ite relations with CIA; approxi- mately one-half day spent in the Pentagon in addition to other briefings by the Defense Intelligence Agency; and a full week Spent visiting SAC, NORAD and other activities in the United States. We were briefed by the head of every major coraponent in the CIA with the excepticn of three DD/P area divisions whose briefings had to be excluced because of the pressure of time. However, we feel that having heard from four other area divisions the working group had a knowledge of the activities and problems of these units. In addition to the 106 briefings, the working group had more than ten executive sessions in which it discussed and debated at great length its findings and conclusions. Finally, there were 14-0000 some 20 mectings with yourself, and with senior Agency officials to discuss our findings and conclusions. These included at least two sessions with each of the Deputy Directors and with the Assistant Director for National Estiraates and the Assistant Director for Cur. rent Intelligence. 3. The attached report does not purport to be complete or ex. haustive in any respect, but rather it ig an aide memoir to recall to mind our oral discussions and to record some of the reasons and philosophy behind our recommendations, Al . ; Lyman B.

In this connection we would urge that a secretariat be 20 . Ne created, - that the head of this secretariat assign individual re- b | . changed in order to provide more effective support to the DCI, a sponsibilities to each of the personal assistants to the DCI, that / ! dally staff meetings be held for a full exchange on the activities . f of the staff, and that all personnel {n the Agency be advised as . to how to keep the DCI's staff informed Properly of the activities / of the Agency. Comptroller We recommend that the Comotroller's office be brought out from under the DD/S, report directly to the DCI's office and J receive full authority for fotal fiscal control of the Agency. We recommend that the Comptroller be Gesigaated Chair- man of a Financial Policy and Budget Committee composed of i the appropriate senior officers of the Agency. We believe that 14-00000 such @ committee should be kept fully and currently informed of all Agency activities, and in order to be effective should meet c regularly and submit its reports to tae DDCI and DCI, Inspector General We recommend that the Audit Staff be combined with the staff of the Inspector General and that the merged staff report to v the DCI’s office. Ss We believe that the size of the Inspector General Staff should ba increased with qualified professional personnel assigned < wd from their respective components in order to perform more V"\ frequent inspections of Agency unites. We urge‘inspections af % least annually of major operations and of field stations. 4 iS % % General Counsel a We recommend that the General Counsel's staff be -/ removed from the organization of the Deputy Director (Support) J and report directly to the office of the DCI. In sucha position the General Counsel should resume the responsibility for the direction and guidance of the work of the Legislative Counsel, J which is currently the responsibility of the Inspector General, 14-0000 | | | Cable Secretariat ‘ We have examined the Cable Secretariat which is currently : located in the office of the DCI and reports to the Executive Officer, vA We believe it should continus to be in the office of the Director under the careful supervision of the Executive Director. We are con- cerned that as it now operates requirements for cables have not been adequately coordinated, and cables have been disseminated too often on the judgment of junior officers, We believe this needs f. careful study. Contracts | We believe that the Agency is vulnerable on sole-source < contracts for auch activities as TSD and DPD, and that those 7? é Le eee contracts currently in existence should be reviewed and that all: , be a wa such future contracts should be passed on by the DCI's office we prior to approval. Personnel Assignments We believe that the DDCI and DCI should be the fiaal . approving authority for all assignmenta to positions of Chief / or Deputy Chief of Offices (DD/2 Divisions and Staffs) or of field stations and bases, both foreign and domestic. 14-00000 . at We believe the DCI's office should also review all asalgo- K 7 ments in the middis management echelon with particular reference * to insuring the proper language qualifications, operational training and suitability, Public Relations We recommend that the ‘present system of public relations by the Agency be changed. While we see the necessity for the wt DCI to have an assistant in his office handling relations with the | ES public media, we believe that every effort should be made to ; minimize the amount of publicity that CIA Tecéives, : We strongly recommend that the Present practice of giving background briefings to newspapermen cease and that ie - CIA give information to the press only where CIA has something which for operational reasons should be released on an unattri- butable basis, We urge that no public Speeches be given by Agency officials. Reduction {n Force We recommend that the DCI and DDCI insure that the present reduction in force in the Agency include senior officers, particularly suvergrades who are no longer aa effective as they should be in their assignments. 14-00000 Handling of Communications Other Than Cables We note that under present arrangements communications, other than cables are handled by the Records Integration Division: of DD/P, which is not always fully cognizant of the interests of ; £. non-DD/P parts of the Agency. We recommend that the entire “be System of handling incoming and outgoing communications be do subjected to further study with & view to insuring adequate dis- 6emination of all communications, Particularly in DD/I, DD/R CC ne and DD/S, which may have need for Prompt receipt of such material, 4 Executive Director ee mirector We have not tried to spell out the responsibilities of the Executive Director, {nasmuch as we believe this to be primarily | & matter that should be tailored to the personal preferences of i the DCI and DDCI and how they wish to operate their office and : the Agency. We urge, however, that Special attention be directed oa to the avoidance of a straight vertical line of command; i.e,, all Problems should not have to pass through each of the three officers, : Executive Committee aE yommuittee We recommend the creation of an Executive Committee to be chaired by the DDCI and consist of the four Deputies, the 14-00000 Comptroller, and the Assistant to the DCI for Coordination and Intelligence Community Guidance. This Committee, from a policy standpoint, would review proposed major projects and maintain a continuous review of all major activities and make appropriate recommendations thereon to the DCI. This Com- mittee would replace the present Project Review Committee. 14-00000 x —— ay We commend the decision of the DD/P to abolish the position ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTCR (PLANS) Office of the DD/P ee ON ne MHIP of the A/DDP/A, and believe that the restoration of tha previous organization with just the DD/P and COP in the line of command in the front office will result ina clear delineation of responsibili- ties and more efficient operations, The Staffs We studied at some length the staffs in the DD/P. We con- sidered a possible merger of the FI, Cl and CA staffs. We also studied proposals for divesting the staffs of all operational responsi- bilities. We believe that while both are desirable objectives, neither e. are practicable under present circumstances, We therefore urge that the FI, Cland CA Staff functions be drawn closer together under the Chief of Operations and that these organizations insofar as practical act in the classical sense as staffs for the DD/P. We further believe that the Operational Services Staff, the Central Stafe, and the residual of the Cover and Commercial Staff, after the changes recommended below are completed, be transferred to the Central Support Staff which is Proposed, 14-00000 Sytem ten et emt / iNerger of Covert Action Staff and International Crganizationa Division The DD/P has advised us of his desire to merge the Covert Action Staff with the International Crganizations Division. White this is contrary to the trend of divesting staffs of operational duties, we nevertheless do not observe any major reasona against such a merger and believe that it should be tried out in accordance with the DD/P's wishes. Central Support Staff We recommend that the DD/P draw together into a Central Support Staff control of personnel and other support mattera cur- “4 rently decentralized to the divisions and staffs in oxder to locate these functiona directly under him. Special Task Force Cperations We recommend the creation of an organizational entity to be known as "Special Task Force Operations" reporting directly to the DD/P, which shall be activated and deactivated upon need, and which shall be the command mechanisin for handling such projects ag the Cuban operation which demands the creation of an organization from Agency-wide assets. 14-00000 Assistant to DD/P for Paramilitary and Air Support Operations . We recommend the creation of an office in the DD/P to be known as Paramilitary and Air Support Operations, under the direction of an Assistant DD/P, to develop the capability for covert paramilitary and air support Operations. We suggest that the bulk of this new organization be located at c ] ry) du where it will have facilities for organization and training. Such a move will also relieve the burden on the headquarters building. We recommend that the individual to head this organization be drawn from military service and be a senior Colonel or a Brigadier General with wartime para- military experience. Having in mind the total disestablishment of a the DPD in its present form, we recommend that the Air Support Branch of DPD be transferred to the new Paramilitary Office of DD/P. Domestic Division - , au We endorse the-proposal to create a Domestic Division. We strongly urge that the new Domestic Division utilize the Contact Division of OO, which is to be transferred from the DD/I to the DD/P, aa the nucleus for field work in the United States. We also believe that this Domestic Division should take over those functions of the Cover and Commercial Staff presently carried out by the Commercial Group, plus all those activities of the Cover Division which involve rene UAL 14-00000 - SECRET contacts with domestic organizations in the United States such as ’ business and foundations. This would involve the transfer to this... Domestic Division of the Air. Proprietaries Branch of DPD, and of the responsibility for the management of CAT from the DD/S, and of managing Fairways Corporation, In consolidating CAT and Fair- ways into the Air Proprictaries Branch we wish to draw attention to the necessity of having the right man to head this branch. | We would also urge that a complete review be made of the © Agency's present and future requirements for air proprietaries and that a atatement of the requirements be provided the Air Proprictaries Branch indicating exactly what may be needed in all parts of the world. With the création of the Domestic Division we urge that the pD/P examine. the requirements levied by DD/P components on the Office of Security for operational support and if possible reassign these requirements to the Domestic Division in order to relieve the Office | of Security for its more important responsibilities in regard to the security of CIA, Operational Aids Unit The DD/P should have a new unit charged with the following functions: -10- 14-00000 a. Residual TSD activities not transferred to DD/R,. b. Preparation of ‘operational characteristics" for new or improved equipment desired to be developed by DD/R. ec. Close contact with DD/R activities involving develop- ment of items for DD/P. d. The conduct of rigorous field tests of these itema before they are released to divisions for operational use. We recommend that all of the research and development responsi- bilities currently in TSD be transferred to DD/R. Remaining units in TSD should be transferred to the new DD/P division recommended above; e.g., Audio Support less Research and Dévelopment, Photo- graphic Support less R & D, Special Assistance, Intelligence, Personnel, Authentication, and Graphic Arts Reproduction. We note, however, that DD/P himself would prefer to retain under his own responsibility the R & D function as it pertains to specific items to be used by individual agents (audio devices, incendiary items, etc. ). Deputy Chief for British Commonwealth Affairs, Western European Division We recommend the creation in the Western European Division of a second Deputy Chief for British Commonwealth Affaira, We suggest that this Deputy Chief‘have ae hie line responsibilities 14-00000 |: . all matters involving CE 4 . . 7). Further, this officer should have full control authority over . C | 24 and all other components of the Agency, including the DD/I,should keep this officer advised on ‘a daily basis C x 4 War Plans Because of the vital importance of war plans to the Agency's relations to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we recommend that the War Plans Group receive direct support from the DDCI, even though it should remain organizationally as a part of the Central Support Staff ofthe DD/P, > " a: Police Pro g rams . We are convinced that United States Government support to the police in friendly nationa can provide great benefits to the United States and that some of these benefits will assist CIA in its _work,. The President has recently indicated to AID that he wishes this program to receive strong support. We believe that CIA should 14-00000 2 a eh eee ee give it greater support than it has previously received. We recom- mend that the police group in the CI Staff receive such augmentation as is necessary, and that Project C i c 7] be transferred from the NE Division to the CI Staff, Liaison with Department of State a mba iment of state We urge that the DD/P centralize liaison with the Department of State and maintain careful records of all discussions between the. Agency and State Department officials. We note that nearly every: area division chief has a weekly meeting with his counterpart in the Department but that under the present system there is no Grganized method for keeping the central management of thé DD/P informed of what takes place at these meetings. . Advice to State on Black Propaganda « We recommend that the DD/P develop procedures which will insure that other appropriate agencies of the government (Department of State, © Defense, White House and USIA) are kept appropriately informed of black Propaganda activities which otherwise might be misunderstood and believed to be legitimately the views of a foreign power. We have in mind our discussions with the Department which heard expressed concern that ‘the Department was unaware of certain. black propaganda activities relating to Communist China and: conse- quently was led astray. -13- oaiet3 Fane meat Te f 14-00000 acento een nent re ee tern CIA Personnel Under State Cover We recommend that CIA personnel under the Department of State cover make greater efforts to truly live their cover. We. believe in this connection that the DCI should receive assurances from the '.DD/P, after proper study, that CIA allowances for rents, servants and entertainment.are in line with comparable State Department allowances. “Legitimate" LC oF Seover , We recommend that the Agency more and more place people under C or 3 cover by the’ Mepitimate" 1 method of recruiting | individuals, having them [_ 6 F i) and be C og a : and ioliow through a ‘normal CL ot Jeaxeer, CIA should obviously keep Cc Q t q advised concerning these individuals, work with Cc ro) sv 2 on their assignments which will be mutually beneficial, and covertly train them.- By. this method such individuals will be under true C. of 4 cover and will not only be unknown to other intelligence services, but also to their colleagues in c oe J. --14- 14-00000 cect atin tenet nee pnt ene ent ny ene ee eee ee seniene tae et ae ene Latin American Operations We urge that the Agency give high priority to supporting the expansion of activities of Latin America, and insure that the proper level of competence is assigned to these important posts. American Friends of the Middle East We recommend that the ‘Project for support of the organization known as s the American Friends, of the Middle East, which is cur- rently being run by the NE Division, be tranoferred to the 10 Division : inasmuch as it now transcends NE Division area responsibilities and has activities in Africa, or, if it is determined that AFME activities . ° ; . ‘ are not worth the Agency's support, that the project be abolished. -15- 14-0000 ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE x, SPUTY DIRECTOR (INTELLIGENCE) Y ee Office of the DD/I We have carefully reviewed the organization and activities of the DD/I's immediate office and believe that with the addition of a full time deputy he will be able to assert the degree of influence on the management of ‘the units under him required for sound operations. At present his three office assistants provide good staff work in this review, but we did observe that a coa- siderable amount of the intelligence produced in the DD/I area ia reviewed at no higher a level than office chief, if that, ‘ We recommend that the DD/I establish in his office a focal point through which all intelligence, processed or unevaluated, going to the White House must flow. If for reasons of urgency a report is sent to the White House prior to evaluation, we recom- mend that a special notice to the effect that it is unevaluated be attached to the report and that an evaluation follow the report at the earliest possible moment. Board of National Estimates The Office of National Estimates should be strengthened by the addition of one top-level foreign affairs expert to the Board of Estimates, and if obtainable a top-level scientist and a top-level economist. We also believe that the Board would benefit by the 14-00000 addition of an individual experienced in business in the jaternational field, provided one of sufficient caliber could be found who would be willing to spend two.or three years on the Board of Estimates. Control of Estimates We urge that the DCI utilize the USIB to control the scheduling and to limit the number of National Estimates. Office of Operations We recommend that the Office of Operations be abolished, . "that the Contact Division be transferred to DD/P to be the nucleus of the Domestic Division, . “oe ‘The DD/I hae advised us that with the transfer of Contact Division, Office of Operations, to the DD/P, he is considering closer integration of the Foreign Documents Division and the Foreign Broadeast Information Division, These units have a lot in common: both Process unclassified information, both have considerable language capability. We believe such an integration should be considered. On the other hand, the Assistant Director for Central Keference believes very strongly that the Foreign Documents Division should be assigned to OCR. He advances as reasons: that the procurement of foreign documents are arranged by OCR; that the dissemination of the FDD product is handled by OCR; that OCR through its relations with the Library of Congress <1 SeeRET 100000 a, OLUILS . and other agencies is in a good position to assist in coordinating the exploitation of foreign documents, We urge that the DD/I integrate FDD and FBID into the most compatible area of the. DD/I organization. Support of Cenis A oe” : 7 A we Support for the Center for International Studies {CENIS) 2 at MIT is currently being handled by the DD/P.. If auch support . ( is worth continuing, and we question this, we recommend that it be transferred to the DD/I's office. -18- SECRET 14-00000 ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR (SUPPORT) Security Office We recommend that the burden on the Security Office for support of the DD/P be reviewed (see DD/P section). Ia the meantime, we believe that a careful look at the Security Office ie necessary to insure that the volume of work it is carrying is not in any way jeopardizing {ta primary responsibility of . insuring that every‘possible measure is taken to keep the Agency “gecure. | We recommend that all security clearanges be centralized under the Office of Security; ¢.g., clearances tuat are issued by DPD, OCI, NPIC, and other Agency components. While we would leave the policy of granting clearances with the appropriate officials, we believe that the Office of Security should maiatain a centralized index for special clearances and do all of the processing of these clearances. Audit Staff We recommend that the Inspection and Audit Staff check regularly on activities in the ockdBSE plant which are of vital concern to the Agency. -19- e b Rel 14-00000 - -- DD Support Ye recommend that the DD/S be given the responsibility for -support to all projects under the control of DD/R, providing of course the necessary eecurity safeguards, and that in the future no parallel support mechanism be developed in the Agency. Automatic Data Processing We believe the Automatic Data Processing Steff can properly remain under the DD/S inasmuch as thia ls a support mechanism, although we atrongly recommend that the DD/S iu consultation with other deputies concerned direct this staff to aggressively pursue the objective of automation in the Agency in such a way as to insure the ultimate compatability of auto- matic data processing aystems throughout the intelligence aon community... 14-0000 ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR (RESEARCH) The Office of the Deputy Director (Research) having already been created, we now make the following recommendations as to those units which should be included under this Deputy. Development Projects Division - Special Projects Branch We recommend that the Special Projects Branch of DPD plus the necessary supporting elements, including those projects supporting the Department of Defense in advance reconnaissance programs, be placed under DD/R. Technical Services Division ee ervices vivision .We recommend that all TSD research and development be placed under DD/R. _ ‘ Other Research and Development We recommend that the extent to which research and development for SIGINT collection equipment, including agents! SIGINT equipment, air-borne collection, etc., should be transferred to DD/R, be left as a matter for negotiation and agreement between DD/I and the Director of Communications, We recommend all research and development in support of NPIC be transferred to DD/R. 14-00000 3 yee PART Ul This section contains comments and recommendations on areas of the work of the Central Intelligence Agency and activities of the intelligence community in which the working group was either unable to agree, or felt that considerably more study was needed before action is taken. These views are presented herewith so that they may assist and guide those who may be asked to pursue these matters further. 14-00000 Coordination We note your intention to abolish the present office of the Assistant for Coordination and to create in its stead an Assistant to DCI for Coordination and Intelligence Community Guidance. With the exception of Mr. ‘Coyne, we are fully in accord. We set forth below our concept of the principal functions of this Assistant. a. He should be the DCI'a principal advisor on coordina- tion matters within the community and his personal representative in dealing on such matters with top officials of the community. b. When 80 directed he should represent the DCI in negotiations and discussions on intelligence mattérs with appropriate officials of foreign governments. c. He should be responsible for development of Comint and Elint policy insofar as thie is an Agency function. _ d, He should keep continually under review the general extent and direction of the intelligence efforts of the community to insure that such efforts fully and effectively support national policy, submitting reports and recommendations to DCI as appropriate. e. He should correspondingly maintain a continuing review of activities and efforts of the Agency to insure that they remain fully and effectively coordinated with the activities and efforta of other members of the community, 14-0000 Soe en MT Si ee Hite We do not consider it practicable at this time to suggest the number or qualificaticns of supporting staff officers for this Assistant, We feel, however, that he will need a group of such officers and that they should be of particularly high caliber and broad experience. The functions we visualize for thia office are highly important for the community and for CIA. They have not been adequately handled in the past. The Assistant should be given whatever staff the full development of his role may later require. Mr. Coyne does not concur in this recommendation. He die. agrees with (a) the proposed organizational placement and title of the recommended office, ‘because this would perpetuate the present ineffective arrangement of the Coordination Office now in existence and would not provide the recommended office with the stature required to ‘assist the DCI in fulfilling hia heavy responsibilities throughout the Intelligence Community; (b) the limitations in the functional concepts of the office, as outlined above. Further, he does not con- cur in this recommendation because it does not distinguish sufficiently the internal CIA operating functions of the DDCI from the community- wide functions which the recommended office must perform if the DCI is to execute effectively his principal mission as as signed in the President's Directive of January 16, 1962. Mr. Coyne believes 14-00000 that if the office is established along the lines recommended above, it will be incapable of effectively assiating the DCI in performing his principal Presidentially-assigned responsibilities of (a) coordinating and effectively guiding the total U. S, foreign intelli- " gence effort; (b) establishing necessary policies and procedures to assure adequate coordination of foreign intelligence activities at all levels; (c) maintaining a continuing review, with the heads of the Departments and Agencies concerned, of the programs and activities of all U. S. agencies engaged in foreign intelligence activities; and ’ (d) assuring efficiency and effectiveness, and avoiding undesirable duplication in the total foreign intelligence effort, Mr. Coyne will a submit his recommendations on this subject at a later date." Princeton Consultants to ONE 'Mr. Coyne recommends that«this group be disbanded based on advice from principal concerned officers of the Agency that the group makes no contribution to the intelligence estimating effort. The other members feel that on balance the group should be continued. National Photographic Interpretation Center We are concerned about the capability of NPIC to handle what may be a greatly increased volume of work in coming months. We - 25 14-00000 recommend that as a matter of priority the USIB have this matter reviewed and insure that any increased flow of raw material does not result in slowing down the prompt and complete proces sing's0 urgently required, Caliber of Personnel We believe that the DD/I should davote some considerable: effart to improving the caliber of personnel in his offices. Although we did not make a study in depth, we believe that there is a serious _ Problem in this regard in OCI and that steps should be taken under the new management of OCI to improve the caliber of supervisory personnel and thus improve the morale of that office. Merger of ONE and Oc! We studied at some length the feasibility of merging the Office of National Estimates with the Office of Current Intelligence. We found the Office of Current Intelligence eager for a merger, the Office of National Estimates strongly opposed, The DD/I was inclined to favor it, but foresees certain personnel difficulties. We do not believe that such a merger would be wise unless it was well esta- blished that the result would be the creation of better national estimates and current intelligence dailies and weeklies, The DD/I feels that 14-0000 he should be given at least sixty days to explore this proposal and to prepare his recommendations. We concur, . Mr. Coyne does not agree with the above paragraph and in lieu thereof recommends that the ONE and OCI be merged now, He believes that such merger will result in improved intelligence products to support the national policy makers. / Preparation and Dissemination of Memoranda We have noted considerable unhappiness in the Department of State because ONE and OCI have established the practice of distri- buting throughout the community, and to the White House, uncoordinated memoranda on intelligence matters. These memoranda are prepared as ‘think pieces", but the Department of State feels that they often seem to influence policy at high levels. We think the Department of State has a point, and we urge’that such memoranda be carefully restricted to circulation within the Agency unless or until they have been coordinated across-the-board, ‘We also urge that the DCI adopt the practice of asking other “agencies to prepare such memoranda if the subjects fall within the purview of their responsibilities; e.g., the Department of State on strictly political matters. We believe that, at a minimum, when CIA is asked for a memorandum that inquiries should be made of * 14-0000 other departments to determine whether such a memorandum hasn't already been prepared or might be in the process of preparation, White House Relations We are concerned about Agency relationships with the White House insofar as handling of intelligence matters ie concerned. We would like the opportunity to discuss this with you orally before framing recommendations. Research on International Communism We are concerned about the reported inadequacy of research done on International Communism. At the present time some is done in the DD/I area in both OCI and ONE, some is done in the DD/P area in the International Communism Division of the Counter Intelli- gence Staff, and some is done in the State Department in the Special Studies Group of INR. The DD/I expressed himself as believing this was sufficiently covered. The Chief, CI Staff believes it is insufficiently covered, Representatives of the Department of State - urged that greater expertise be brought to bear on the subject. Inasmuch as it will fall squarely on the shoulders of the DCI if not enough is being done, we urge that the matter be reviewed by the DCI at an early date to satisfy himself that all necessary research in this field is being accomplished. - 28 - 14-0000 Office of Scientific Intelligence On the new chart we have shown OSI as a division under DD/R since we understand this to be'your desire. We feel, however, that OSI in its major activities is more closely linked to DD/I than to DD/R and therefore more properly belongs under DD/I. DD/I himself ‘strongly supports this view and urges that he retain OSI. We believe that if this is approved, scientists in OSI should be members of DD/R's career service, subject to transfer between OSI and units of DD/R as might be agreed between the deputy directors concerned, DD/R's Operational Responsibilities We have some concern relative to your intention to have DD/R carry into the operational phase his responsibility for certain major projects involving complex and coordinated operations which are highly sensitive and where a mis;step could have serious national or international repercussions. DD/R's key people will be mostly scientists, technological experts or leaders in specialized develop- ment fields. Such individuals on the average have no professional intelligence operating experience and little background or interest in detailed operational problems requiring thorough inter-agency coordination, painstaking and tedious follow-up actions and careful attention to security details. DD/ P, on the other hand, has a number 14-0000 - of top-flight people who for some years have dealt almost exclusively with just such problems. We recognize all the difficulty, in the course of a project of this type, of shifting responsibility from one deputy to the other; and we realize that development must also lap over into the operational phase. We suggest having as a general rule (but granting that excep- tions will arise) that when operation begins the responsibility for the ‘perations should be the DD/P'a, but that DD/R should retain his responsibility for seeing that the equipment he has developed continues to function properly. There is here attached a specially clagsified annex. “¢ 14-0000 . . . . 3 i. ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE fs INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY National Indications Center - ‘/atch Committee ) We have examined quite carefully the National Indications Center, its organization, its capacity to support fully the Watch Committee, and its relations with other departments and agencies, We note that opinions within the community concerning NIC and its functions vary widely -- from the feeling that it should be abolished, or combined with DIA indications center -- to the belief that it is entirely satisfactory in its present situation. We do not fully sub- scribe to either of these views. “ i The functions of the Watch Committee, and NIC, with their terms of reference, were developed prior to the time when DIA was , created, Now DIA has developedsa strong capability to provide both early warning and indications of approaching crises to the community. Its capacity in thia regard will develop even further in the months ahead. We are aware that USIB is now considering the Fitch Committee Report, But we doubt that few if any members of that Committee were intimately aware of the full capacity of DIA and of its future plans. We note that General Carroll was reluctant to be drawn into the Committee's deliberations. 14-00000 We recommend, therefore, that except as noted below, NIC operations be allowed to continue as they are for the next three or four months, At that time we recommiend a thorough review of the Watch Committee and NIC operations, particularly in the light of DIA's capabilities and activities, with a view to redefining the responsibilities and functions of NIC as may then appear desirable. Mr. Coyne disagrees and recommends that the NIC be abolished now, and that the DIA be assigned the national-strategic warning fanction and that its personnel complement be enlarged to include representation from appropriate members of USIB. Mr. Coyne points to reasons outlined in his memorandum to the DCI dated February 5, 1962. We do believe that the National Indications Center should be properly manned and should receive both the high caliber of per- sonnel at the proper grade and the number of personnel to perform its function promptly and efficiently. In this connection the Depart- ment of State has no representatives at NIC at present and the DCI should ask the Secretary to remedy this situation immediately. We would suggest a change in the present method of preparing the Watch Committee report. If NIC is adequately manned, we see no reason why it should not draft, 24 hours in advance, the weekly 14-0000 eebhtr _ Watch Committee report, circulate it to all agencies for considera- tion prior to discussion at the Watch Committee meeting when it could be decided upon in final form and reproduced and disseminated. Related to the Watch Committee -- but also an important aspect of all coordinated intelligence community reports -- we believe that substantive disagreements should be encouraged and even spelled out in Watch Committee reports; that NIEs and SNIEs rather ‘than being suppressed or covered by watered down language as is some- times the case today, in all cases should reflect the consensus of. views of the intelligence community. If there are differing’ minority views on the part of one or more agencies, including CIA, these should be spelled out in sppropriats footnotes. ; CIA Relations with the Department of State a. . We examined the relations of CIA with the Department of State. : Several matters of concern in this area are mentioned in the section on the DD/P. We would note that "covering" for the Agency poses certain problems for the Department in its relations with the Congress, These include such items that attract Congressional interest as: - the number of officers in each Embassy, particularly the political section; the designation of CIA officers asL2¥); the CIA role in -- 33 + 14-0000 handling State communications, etc. In these areas we recommend close liaison be maintained with State on Congressional. matters and that whenever possible State be given a helping hand with the appro- priate Congressional committees on these matters. We are particularly concerned that the c 2 7 2 designa- tions of CLA personnel c 24 J, particularly c oe are 20 revealing. We recommend that the Agency arrange with State to : | Cc - ¢ 2 o J designations. The Department of State indicated concern about the level in CIA on which Comint policy matters are handled, and also. noted that on occasions there appears to be lack of coordination within CIA on Comint policy matters. This factor is one. of the reasons why we recommend raising the level of Sigint policy matters to the Assistant _ to the DCI for Coordination and Intelligence Community Guidance. State's Counter Communism Office erm wice We reviewed with some interest the proposed creation in the office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs of the Department of State of a strategy group for combatting communism. While the full scope of its function is ag yet unclear, wa believe that - CIA should follow the developments in this office closely as ite activities will have considerable bearing on the work of the Agency. 14-0000 State's Overational Center We reviewed with some interest the embryonic operational center which the Department of State is developing. We found that this is an interesting development and would obviously have bearing ‘on the intelligence community, State at White House Briefings We recommend that in accordance with the present practice of a representative of the Defense Intelligence Agency attending the briefings of the White House staff by CIA, that a representative of the Department of State also be invited to attend these meetings, a Receipt of Top Classification Messages We recommend that the DCI take up directly with the President the preblem of receiving all pertinent messagea dealing with foreign affairs which might have any bearing on intelligence estimates or reports, or on covert operations. We have particularly in mind such communications as between the President and Khrushchev, etc. We believe that it is important for the DCI to see such messages in order to give proper guidance to the intelligence and operational activities of the Agency.

We suggest that the bulk of this new organization be located at Isolation where it will have facilities for organization and training. Such a move will also relieve the burden on the headquarters building, We recommend that the individual to head this organization be drawn from military service and be a senior Colonel or a Brigadier General with wartime para- military experience. Having in mind the total disestablishment of the DPD i in ita Present form, we recommend that the Air Support Branch of DPD be transferred to the new Paramilitary Office of Dp/P. Domestic Division - a ee sion We endorse the proposal to create a Domestic Division. We strongly urge that the new Domestic Division utilize the Contact Division of OO, which is to be transferred from the DD/I to the DDIP, aa the nucleus for field work in the United States. We also believe that this Domestic Division should take over those functions of the Cover and Commercial Staff presently carried out by the Commercial : Group, plus all those activities of the Cover Division which involve 14-0000 - Wasi all matters involving liaison with the British or with Canadian) mee | Australian and New Zealand intelligence service a except mattera | (concerned with Sigint and Comsee, Further, this officer should have full control authority over liaison exchange of information - c with the British and the above mentioned Commonwealth services;) and all other components of the Agency, including the DD/I, should keep this officer advised ona daily basis ‘of Haison relations with es < the E British services! . . War Plans Becauge of the vital importance of war plans to the Agency's - relations to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we recommend that the War Plans Group receive direct support from the DDC], even though it should remain organizationally as a part of the Central Support Staff ofthe DD/P, . Police Prog rams . We are convinced that United States Government support to . the police in friendly nations can provide great benefits to the United States and that some of these benefits will assist CIA in its _work,. The President has recently indicated to AID that he wishes this program to receive strong support. We believe that CIA should 14-D0000 worsened give it greater support than it has previously received. We recom- _ mend that the police group in the CI Staff receive such augmentation as is necessary, and that Project § ENDOMORPH (police training? u ‘school)’be transferred from the NE Division to the CI Staff, \ | | | ! | | Liaison with Department of State | ° We urge that the DD/E P centralize liaison with the Department of State and maintain careful records of all discussions between the Agency and State Department officials, We note that nearly every. area division chief has a weekly meeting with his counterpart in the Department but that under the present system there is no organized . : method for keeping the central management of thé Db/P informed i ‘of what takes place at these meetings, Advice to State on Black Propag anda We recommend that the DD/ P develop procedures which will insure that other appropriate agencies of the government (Department of State, Defense, White House and USIA) are kept appropriately oe | informed of black propaganda activities which otherwise might be misunderstood and believed to be legitimately the views of a foreign power. We have in mind our discussions with the Department which heard expressed concern that the Department was unaware of certain black propaganda activities relating to Communist China and conse-- quently was led astray. 14-0000 CIA Personnel Under State Cover We recommend that CIA personnel under the Department of State cover make greater efforts to truly live their cover. We. believe in this connection that the DCI should receive assurances from the : DD/P, after proper study, that CIA allowances for rents, servants and entertainment are in line with comparable State Department . allowances. "Le gitimate" Foreign Service) Cover We recommend that the Agency more and more place people under: Foreign Service cover by the’ MLogitimate' method of recruiting individuals, having them take and j pass the Foreign Service exams and be éommissioned in the F = oreign Service and foliow through a ‘normal 3 Foreign Service/career, CIA should obviously keep the ?

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 22 November 1968 MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security SUBJECT : Herbert Itkin/Mario Brod et.al. 1. Reference is made to your instructions concerning this case and my attached memorandum concerning research on whether > or not Itkin was ever, in fact, utilized by this Agency prior to his : contacts with Brod. 2. All available sources in the Agency reflect no record of Itkin or of Philip Harbin, who was allegedly his case officer. Harbin has been checked both as a true mame and as an alias. Although the name is not registered in the Agency, this of course does not mean } that some Agency representative did not make this up and use it without telling anyone. 3. My visceral reaction is that Itkin is lying about his contacts with Mr. Dulles and Philip Harbin. However, since there appears to be a possibility of an extreme "flap" if Itkin gives the same story to the-newspapers that he gave to Mr. Houston, I would recommend that, with the concurrence of Mr. Helms, Mr. Dulles be interviewed and asked if he remembers anything about this case. - « aa 4. Lalso spoke with Harry Mason, x5231, in Finance who handles OS budgetary matters and is a personal acquaintance. Without giving him any names I asked him if it would be possible to track down the receipt that Itkin claims he gave Harbin for the $5000.00. Harry says if the case was handled properly and the account is still outstanding it will be fairly easy to find the receipt. I have done nothing further on this, pending your instructions. Zz - WA — Ward K. Ge€ene SA/EPD Attachment RETURN To cv Backgroun Ls aie ‘'. 22 November 1968 ITKIN, Herbert . Subject States: When he was first admitted to the bar in 1953 he was employed by the firm of Delson, Levin & Gordon in New York City. (Now Delson and Gordon.) Itkin alleges that one partner, Levin, had close ties with Alger Hiss, Cyrus Eaton and other of similar persuasion. Because of the viewpoint of the law firm, Subject states that he began passing information to Senator Joseph McCarthy. However, in the Spring of 1954, Senator McCarthy told Itkin that he was getting into trouble and allegedly reported that he had passed Itkin's reports to CIA. Itkin then states that a meeting was set up for him either in June/July/or August of 1954 with Mr. Allen Dulles. This meeting was at the Bellevue Stratford in Philadelphia. His contact was reportedly a man known as Philip Harbin. At this time, Itkin says he was able to report on matters affecting U Nu, then the Premier of Burma, the Indonesian Foreign Minister; and the owner or editor of the New Delhi Times. Itkin also claims to have had personal contacts with Luis Gutierrez, Consul General of El Salvador, and with a number of other people who had Guatemalan contacts. Itkin says the only money he received from Harbin was $5,000.00, which was supposed to be repayable and for which he gave a receipt, he believes sometime in 1957, He said the money was notsrepaid. Itkin states that he met Mario Brod in 1961 and that Brod was represented to him as a former Colonel in the OSS who had intelligence connections. From then on his contact was Brod and apparently Harbin dropped out of the picture. No No No record of Herbert Itkin in Office of Security records, other than newspaper clippings. record of Herbert Itkin in RI files. record of Philip Harbin in Office of Security. record of Philip Harbin as a DCS alias. record of Philip Harbin in OS pseudo files. record of Philip Harbin as either a pseudo or a registered alias in RI/CRYPTO. record of Philip Harbin in RI files. The file of Mario Brod reflects no information concerning his contacts with Herbert Itkin and reflects no information concerning a Philip Harbin. During Itkin's meeting with Mr. Houston he mentioned that the law firm had a negro lawyer named Thomas L. Roberts, #193026, who had very useful contacts with the United Nations. Itkin stated that Roberts was a very presentable and intelligent negro who left the firm and now had a law practice in Dakar. _ The Office of Security file concerning Roberts reflectsthat: of Mr. Roberts|is a current employee of this Agency under doep cover in Dakar] In January of 1968 Roberts furnished this Office with an extensive summary of his past association with Herbert Itkin. He also mentioned that he and Itken had associated with Mario Brod at a dinner party in 1965 and had had lunch with Brod in 1967. There is no indication, however, that Roberts is aware of any use of Itken aa a CIA informant during the 1950's. cmare EYCS5 ONLY;14-aannn 104-10119-10182) [2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F.

He notes in the foreword his hope that someone would have written this book so that he would not have to do it; now convinced that, if he does not write it, it will never be written, _he has taken up his pen "reluctantly and in a mood of nostalgic bitterness.’ nilton states that he has used no official files or documents and has - ted no one in preparing this work, Where true names are used in ynanuecript for CIA personnel, he writes that they have been publicly tified before, and in this contention I believe that he is correct, with esible exception offjim Koei] The author's claim that this book would provide no information not known to Castro's intelligence service, or that details this late are of no value to the opposition.is, in my view, seriously open to question. 3.
