Pallot This is a Florida Corporation established by and under the control of JMWAVE and certified to do business in Florida. Ace Marine Survey, Inc. was formerly known as Ace Cartography Company, a corporation which had been certified to do business in Florida on 11 July 1962. This Corporation was amended on 4 November 1966 to its new name, Ace Marine Survey, Inc. The President of the Corporation is Alfred J. Moran of New Orleans, Louisiana. Mr. Moran is a very prominent businessman in the New Orleans area. He is head of Kalvar and has investments in a variety of businesses which include many oil interests. He is known to Headquarters represen- tatives particularly in Logistics. OSTENSIBLE BUSINESS: Ace Marine Survey, Inc., is engaged primarily USE : FUNDING in marine research including the study of marine life and testing of marine equipment. However, its general provisions permit it to perform almost any corporate function. JMWAVE use of the Corporation is to provide cover for a maritime vessel, the M/V SONORA. The Corpora- tion provides status cover and payrolling of the agents assigned to the M/V SONORA and the safe area or berthing site from which the vessel operates in the performance of its ostensible business. a4 Method - This account is funded through the [Bank and Hall covert account at the First National Bank of Miami] by the following method: A check in the total amount of the deposits is drawn on this account.

Maritime Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967: This cover company should be affected little by a flap. However, because of the berthing location within largely tourist or recreation areas, its commercial activity has been noted. Cover Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967: A successor to Ace Cartography Company, Ace Marine Survey, Inc., is currently used in connection with the leasing of a waterfront berthing site for the berthing of M/V SONORA, which is registered under this firm. The firm also provides cover and serves as well as the vehicle for payrolling the agent crew. Ace Marine Survey, Inc.,is engaged in the field of marine research, including the study of marine life as well as the testing of marine equipment. In view of the current limited use of this cover, the likelihood of exposure is considerably reduced. However, if such an exposure did occur, it is felt that the damage to either WOFACT or the officers of Ace Marine Survey, Inc., would be of no great import. The major likely "injury" that would be sustained would be the denial of further use of the berthing site and the need for re-naming/re-register- ing the M/V SONORA. In order to add depth and lend further substance to the cover story, the officers of a legitimate Qy/ firm,[ Offshore Navigation Company, New Orleans, Louisiana, which is engaged in marine research and off-shore oil exploration activities, have agreed to backstop the activities of Ace Marine Survey, Inc. and to recognize the latter firm as a client.

ASSESSMENT OF VULNERABILITY: 1. Maritime Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967 —- The cover mechanism established by the Ceres Enterprises, Inc. was very secure during the period of its operation and remained so until the loss of one of its agents who was captured in Cuba. This made it necessary to terminate the activities of this corporation and transfer its activities to another entity. This was accomplished without any unusual events or actual public exposure. If any should occur at this late date, the damage would be minimal. Cover Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967 - This corporation is currently inactive and will become legally dormant after three years. It was placed in this status due to an operational flap which could have exposed the corporation. The last active tax return was filed at the tax year ending March 31, 1966. An additional tax return will be filed for the past tax year which will indicate no financial transactions. Its assets and activities were transferred to other JMWAVE entities. This corporation was established to provide cover for a Maritime Branch vessel and status and payroll cover for the agents assigned to it. The corporation is inactive and will be allowed to remain so. It was placed in this status due to a flap wherein an agent was captured in Cuba who had knowledge of this vessel and its ownership. There was no public exposure in the Miami area. However, because of the past incident the corporation should not be used in the future under its current name. While in use the corporation served very satisfactorily for the purpose for which it was established. °;14-00000 104-10105-10102) rd . [2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 | 1 July 1976 MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security : 3 C«C FROM ot Gherwood R. Bosworth > ternal Activities Branch SUBJECT : Manuscript by David Phillips , : 1. Attached herewith is a proposed letter to Mr. David A. Phillips outlining deletions which the Agency would like made from his book. The general tone of the responses from Agency components was that, if possible, this book should not be published. In the view of most, it dangerously reveals sources and methods, internal organization, missions, and functions. It also provides public confirmation of covert Agency activities and the disruption and’ reduced morale created by Agee and ‘others. . 2. However, on the assumption that publication could not or would not be blocked, the operating components catalogued their most serious concerns. The attached letter to Mr. Phillips includes many of these reservations. The chapter by chapter review, which appears later in this memorandum, contains those recommendations for deletion which, for various explained reasons, should not be forwarded to Mr. Phillips. : 3. Before proceeding with the manuscript review, we would like to advise that Mr. John Greaney of OGC has volunteered his services to accompany you or Mr. Stembridge when our proposals are placed before Mr. Phillips. Due to time limitations, he has not had a chance to review this memorandum or the proposed letter to Mr. Phillips as of this date. OS 6 2899-A 14-0000 PRETO V0 ox > yn ae Uss 2 On ; 4. The following is a compilation of items of concern to Agency components which were not included in the letter to Mr. Phillips. This does not include chapters one and six which have been previously reviewed and returned to Mr. Phillips. S. Chapter two: Guatemala a. Several offices expressed concern that this + book, for the first time, confirms the CIA's role with Col. * Armas and the coup. However, since it would be difficult to defend a classification on this, it was not included in the letter to Mr. Phillips. The same was true of the reference to the coup in Iran (p. 43). b. Another area of concern was our relationship with the FBI in connection with his arrest and our use of false identity papers in the U. S.. Of particular concern was mention of a capability to alter FBI criminal records. Again, we. don't believe we can prove classification. c. The one item which could have been deleted was a footnote on page 35 which inferred that the CIA . had indemnified Lloyd's of London. for a sunken ship.. LA Division was able only to ascertain that no payment had been made as of August 1960. Since the footnote ‘begins "press reports claimed that . .."without further specifying the source, we felt it best to make no comment to Mr. Phillips on this point. 6. Chapter three: Havana and Beirut a. Some concern was expressed regarding the paragraph on page 13 explaining salary off-set for deep cover officers. Although this may be truely classified, it might be best to let it remain as is, to dissuade. readers that the Agency or its officers are making extra ‘money on the side. b. Other comments related to the details of Mr. Wisner's death (p. 5); connecting Ernest Hemmingway with the Havana COS (p. 21); and confirming that an 14-0000 } iA Berner TO CIA ’ ackground Use Ont . Go Mot § Roprecuce American executed by the Cubans was a CIA NOC (p. 48). The latter point, while clearly sensitive, was not raised to Mr. Phillips as LA Division posed no specific objection. . 7. Chapter four: Bay of Pigs a. Some objection was raised to Mr. Phillips citing the Gulf Steamship Company as a cover for the broadcasting aspect of the Bay of Pigs operation. However,’ in checking this out, it was learned that the cover was the Gibralter Steamship Company so no objection is made to the use of Gulf. b. SSU also raised questions regarding the confirmation of assassination planning against Castro (p. 12) and the use of the Alban Towers Hotel as a temporary lodging facility for Agency personnel (p. 17). Since no one else raised an objection on these points, they were not relayed to Mr. Phillips. 8. Chapter five: Mexico City a. In addition to all the comments directed to Mr. Phillips (see attached letter), the SSU objected to discussion of the purchase of scotch (p. 15), the specifics associated with the Cuban missile crisis (pp. 25-27), and the handling of "walk-ins" (pp. 33-35). LA Division also objected to the Agency's role in name tracing (p. 8). b. In view of the considerable deletions requested of Mr. Phillips, the above were not included as their ‘sensitivity and justification for classification appears to be marginal. 9. Chapter seven: . Washington, D. C. a. Several offices took exception to some items in this chapter: which were not passed on to Mr. Phillips. b. The SSU objected to the mention of liquor in the Director's dining room and the footnote confirming 14-0000 we 7 RETURNS Cla Background Use Oy = a CIA role in the Glomar Explorer (p. 26). In view of the fact that GSA is now trying to rent or sell the ship, we don't feel we can justify a classification on these items. c. The DDO objected tothe general discussion of cover starting on page 29, but we could not pin the. . objection down to specifics. SSU commented that Mr. Phillips reveals the, location of many stations around the world (including (Brazzavillé)on page 31), but deletions of the ., names woul be, difficu t to justity legally. - d. Both the SSU and LA Division objected to Mr. Phillips mention of assassination attempts on Castro (pp. 42-44), but, again, we would have trouble defending the classification of the information presented. 10. Chapter eight: Rio de Janeiro and Caracas a. The most sensitive objections to this chapter involved the information on pages 15 to 20 of our role in Chile - Track II. These included the allegation of back-channel correspondence and the fact that the information could distort the public's view of the whole affair. Unfortunately, no one could tie it to the sources and methods or classification questions and therefore it was not included in the Phillips letter. ; b. Other items of concern were the discussion of cover in Brazil (pp. 2-3); the operational use of -women (p. 23); the employment of blacks (p. 26), espécially the revelation that two black officers in Brazil were CIA officers, jeopardizing their cover, and that Army commo went through the Agency during: the Dominican crisis (p- 31). While all of these could cast us in a questionable light or make operational life more difficult, it would be difficult to justify their deletion on legal grounds. 11. Chapter nine: LA Division ; ‘a. Although the requested deletions from this chapter are rather lengthy, they do no include all reservations raised by our offices. ‘ 14-0000 b. Several offices objected to references to the assassination of President Kennedy and the Watergate affair (pp. 5, 16, 30). These were rather innocuous and could probably not be justified on legal grounds. c. The second objection was the author's general verification of the information in the Agee book and the impact of this book on the Agency. Again, deletion would be difficult to justify, but you may wish to discuss the . damage potential with Mr. Phillips directly... 12. Chapter ten: Retirement _ The DDO raised the question that Mr. Phillips statement on page 12 that he knew Agee has been to Cuba five times betrays knowledge he gained either from travel programs or liaison services. This would be a difficult point to argue in any confrontation with Mr. Phillips. 13. Epilogue a. The SSU questioned whether this manuscript is the proper vehicle to surface the fact that two cables sent to Santiago in May 1973 established our non-involvement in the overthrow of Allende (p. 6). We could see no justification to strike this. b. The SSU further believes that revelation of friction between Mr. Colby and Dr. Kissinger (p. 13) is also improper. Perhaps'so, but difficult for us to press for deletion. ; c. And last, the SSU objected to comments on pp. 14-18 which are suggestive of Agency judgements and evaluation regarding the conduct and success of the investigative efforts as well as other personalities critical of the Agency.

From sur- veilling the group's movements it. was established that the intention was to travel to an adjoining area, where a “major energy installation, we assumed, might be their target. CIA, through liaison, warned the authorities of that country and appropriate defense measures were taken. I_instructed the CIA Station in (Costa Brava \to advise. the president that the ,terr ists might be using his country as‘?.. SEGRET 14-0000 Pages 38-41: LA Division recommends that the passage on the ter- rorist kidnapping in the Dominican Republic be deleted . for the following reasons: 1) This incident is still fresh in the minds of most Dominicans and it is unrealistic to assume that it will not be picked up and published in the local press. Barbara Hutchison, USIA, one of the people kidnapped, is still in the Dominican Republic and, according to two recent reports, is again being considered as a target for kidnapping. The potential for terrorist acts against US citizens continues; — three leaders of terrorist-oriented groups are in prison and publication of this item could propel the | terrorists into action. 2) The close link between the ambassador and the station, as portrayed in the book could be pre- judicial to his public image and might even provoke the terrorists to target against him. ra 3) The station has renewed a (liaison relation- ship and much effort is being directed toward deve- potual confidence. Revelation of details of a Goin operation )by a former division, chief might lead the increasingly friendly fiiaison contact to - wonder whether we can maintain confidence on future operations and thereby throw the new relationship into jeopardy. 4) Although the bugging of the thermos was discovered and appeared in the press, the use of the Coca Cola case was not exposed and. therefore continues to be an operational possibility, at. least as far as the Dominican Republic is concerned. | Revelation of the technique by Agee should not be a criterion for further disclosure.

The general tenor of the manuscript leaves much to be desired from both an operational and security viewpoint. The author in numer- ous instances specifically discloses sources, methods, cover arrange- vo ments and liaison relationships. Various LA Division officer who have ig reviewed portions of the manuscript pertinent to their areas have i commented negatively on the revelations of tradecraft and identifica- tion of numerous overseas Stations and operations. 2. Other objectionable items in the manuscript concern the con- firmation of Agee's effectiveness in neutralizing Agency efforts abroad by publishing lists of CIA personnel in specifig,Stations; revelation 2% of Office of Communications)personnel in (every Embassy abroad;) the Agency role in countering terrorism, narcotics trafficking and training provided other services to counteract these activities; and, the specific identity of liaison relationships, particularly, (the Israeli 24 service.) . 3.

Phillips ‘ 1. The following passages are a compilation of observations made. by the. SSU regarding Mr. Phillips' manuscript. The comments are by no means a total list of reservations concerning the submitted chapters but those noted from the perspective of the SSU. 2. In.general the undersigned felt somewhat enlight- ened but rather uncomfortable in reading the submitted manuscript. This uneasy feeling appears to be based upon two impressions. Throughout the text, there is an obvious effort on the part of Mr. Phillips to "set the record straight" with-regard to events, techniques and activities involving the CIA. Regrettably, as is often the case when one attempts to clarify and present the real facts, there is a possibility of further compounding a confused and ambiguous circumstance. Because of the various ramifications of the activities of the Agency, the SSU gained the feeling that more was lost rather than won in Mr. Phillips' efforts. The second disarming im- pression is that because an individual has proved to be an effective and successful CIA operations officer, there is no clear-cut assurance that he can achieve the same success as an author. The SSU was continually pained by Mr. Phillips’ efforts to employ certain techniques often seen in spy fictions. The problem with author Phillips is that he is not writing fiction and has been identified as a former CIA employee with over 25 years in intelligence service. Although Mr. Phillips labored to introduce some humor into his manuscript, some of his anecdotes appear to be in bad taste. 3. The following comments are codified to complement those parts of the manuscript reviewed in this reading. Epilogue Page 6: Although Mr. Phillips makes a considerable effort to conceal the true identity of "Abe", there is a question as to whether the fact that two cables were sent from Head- quarters to (Chi é) in May 1973, and if this manuscript is the yroper vehicle to surface such information. wd fe-chnone ret av.Gell Hate “RY "CONFIDENTIAL cs noe 14-0000 CONFIDENTIAL , . Page 13: Mr. Colby is quoted by the author indicating certain information revealing complications between Mr. Colby and Dr. Kissinger. In addition to breaching personal confidences, the author contradicts what he had indicated earlier to be an intent to permit Mr. Colby to spedk for himself. Page 14-18: Mr. Phillips again refers ‘to "Abe" and his evaluations of the various congressional select committees investigating the CIA. In effect these comments are suggestive - of Agency judgments and evaluation regarding the conduct and success of the investigative efforts as well as other person- alities critical of the Agency. Chapter 3 Page'5: Have the circumstances regarding Mr. Wisner's death ever been surfaced with such particulars as provided in this text? ‘Page 14: The information regarding the "laundering of money" as set forth in the first paragraphs of this page serves as a confirmation of official involvement in such activities. This should be deleted. : .Page 21: There is a Serious question raised regarding the author connecting Ernest Hemmingway and the Havana Chief of Station implying the prospect of a professional -as well as personal affiliation. ; Page 48: If it is in fact correct, has it ever been officially acknowledged that a U.S. citizen, a businessman in Havana, implied by the author as being a CIA agent was executed? Note: This chapter is replete with a profusion of illustrations of tradecraft and operational activities too numerous to set. forth. Chapter 5 Page 1: Mr. Phillips in his writing provides a historical chronology of senior assignments within the Agency with particular reference to the LA or WH Division. This is illustrated on this page in his reference to Colonel King "regaining leadership of the WH Division". Anyone interested in noting the organizational hierarchy and key personalities in the WH or LA Division during the period of Mr. Phillips' tenure with the Agency, would be aided considerably on page 2 and further as the author proceeds to identify Mr. Winston Scott as the Chief of Station Mexico. CONFIDENTIS 14-00000 uy CONFIDENTIAL |, - » Page 3: Although it has been publicly surfaced that Mr. William F. Buckley had worked for CIA in the past, the author on this page now ties him in with Howard Hunt and Mexico City and further as an American contract agent. The best interests of the Agency are not served nor for that matter the interests of Mr. Buckley and Mr. Hunt are not served by such revelations. Page 4-6: The SSU believes it is totally unwise to . have the mission and organization of the Mexico City Station outlined as explicitly as contained in these pages. | Page 5-6: The above observation is further complicated © by the author's remarks regarding operations levied against the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. Page 8: The SSU further challenges the information set forth on this page regarding the biographic details of Mr. Winston Scott's assignments in Cuba, (London), Eur Division and Mexico City. . 15-} Page 15: The undersigned does not believe the content of the information set forth regarding the Agency's procedures associated with the purchasing of scotch liquor. He is implying. - things which may perhaps have been unique to that station but . certainly has not been a worldwide practice. Mr. Phillips’ -anecdote about the prospects of the Agency printing counterfeit tax stamps and the details involved in such planning, even though perhaps presented in jest would not be viewed as such in the eyes of many individuals in the United States today. Page 16: Because Philip Agee has revealed the secret of the camera operation in his book,is it necessary for Mr. Phillips to repeat and in effect collaborate what a diseffected employee ‘of the Agency is purporting? From a friendly alumnus of the Agency, this serves as a verification of Agee's statements and provides a violation of sources and methods of this organization. Page 18-19: Pursuing the aspect of sources and methods, the SSU questions the author's anecdote regarding the identif- ication and employment techniques of the material "why. me". It would seem that in so far as any chémical or technical devices of this nature used by the Organization should not be surfaced in a book such as this. ; CONFIDENTIAL 14-00000 CONFIDENTIAL Page 25-27: The specifics associated with the Cuban Missle Crisis of 1962 involving former Director John McCone and others are subject to strong question as to whether they should be included in this text. Again, what is provided by Mr. Phillips in this manuscript is drawn from such personal experiences realized in his Agency duties. — ; Page 33-35: The SSU takes exception to the information presented regarding "walk-ins" based upon the same rationale as contained above. It also flirts with the concerns of .sources and methods of this Agency. - Page 46-48: All remarks concerning technical operations such as hidden microphones, quick plants, etc, are out of order particularly with reference to the development of a microphone in the armchair. This again violates the Agency's concern regarding sources and methods. Page 55-61: Considerable inside information is provided regarding Lee Harvey Oswald and his activities in Mexico. -The SSU defers to LA Division, SE Division and 0S regarding the advisability of inclusions of. this material in this manuscript. Chapter 7 Page 26: Although there is a legal basis for the serving of alcoholic beverages in the DCI dining room, is it appropriate to include such "tidbits" providing the news media with grist to conjure up stories of senior CIA executives making critical decisions following an alcvholic luncheon. This implication is synonymous with the problem of beer being available to the Secret Service when they are on assignment with the President. Page 31: Throughout the manuscript the author in his narration confirms the fact that CIA has stations located around the world and in his writing procedes to verify the location of these stations. The comments relating to where he was assigned and where others in the Agency have been or are assigned, not only relates to the South America area but on this page the author confirms the fact that there was a CIA station in [2-32(Brazzaville.) Other than in the change in name there is no effort made “to dispel the prospect that the station continues. Page 42-44: Although it is a most timely subject, . information regarding any U.S. Government effort to assassinate Castro is highly explosive. Mr. Phillips is reporting information which he has privy to as a direct result of his Agency exper- iences. These should not be contained in this book. CONFIDENTIAL 14-0000 a CONFIDENTIAL «© Page 44: Although(Camp tary)has unfortunately been identified as a CIA facility, is it necessary for the author ‘to reinforce media articles regarding this establishment by spelling out the cover background and other "chapter and verse" items regarding this facility. I believe comments regarding firearms training, counterterrorism training should : be avoided. : Chapter 8 . . . Page 7: The author's remarks concerning CIA support . to the Elbrick kidnapping again is a violation of. sources and methods, and should be deleted. Pages 13-21: It is understandable but regrettable that the author continues to single out sensitive issues; i.e,, assasSination and in this instance CIA involvement in Chile. ‘The information contained in these pages are volatile and should not be included in such a commercial venture. Any such information is liable for quotations out of context warping or reinforcing the involvement that the Agency did have in the political activities of Chile. Page 25: For the first time the SSU was made aware of the daughter of a CIA officer who was stripped naked and held with a knife at her throat by political assassins. If this is in fact a true statement, I question the value of such an- inclusion in this text particularly in light of the terrorism problems that this Agency and other elements of the U.S. Government are experiencing around the world. Page 27: The statement the author makes with regard to promotion to GS-17 is not correct. Page 31: I believe that Office of Communications should be consulted on the.entire section relating to communications, communications personnel and the Office of Communications, however, the SSU raises the question concerning the inclusion of teletype decoding speeds on this particular page. Chapter 10 Note: Chapter 10 continues in the same vein as all of the other chapters. It further reinforces the earlier remarks that the more one tries to explain and clarify a point the more confusing it becomes. The remarks contained in pages 23 and 24 regarding Chile are illustrative of this. . 5 ‘py CONFIDENTIAL 14-00000 im CONFIDENTIA in 4. In summary, the SSU joins those who feel that this book would better have been left unwritten. It is a text replete with names, details, operational information and close personal privileged information based upon the author's asSignments which has been rendered into a commercial version of Mr. Phillips' affiliation with this agency for over 25 years. This manuscript reinforces the difficulty of a retired operations officer to. develop a non-fiction text which is attractive to the public but does not contain information . regarding intelligence personalities, organization and sources ‘and methods.

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 | an wy 3 June 1976 MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, External Activities Branch Office of Security FROM : John H. Stein Deputy Chief, Soviet/East European Division. SUBJECT : Manuscript by David Phillips. 1. At the risk of. tilting continually at windmills, it is the undersigned's view, and that of innumerable colleagues, that Mr. Phillips' book should not be published. In the first instance, those portions we have read are superficial and give the reader the impression that the profession which Mr. Phillips practiced so well is one of derring-do, frivolity and foolishness. - More seriously, the entire book is based on knowledge acquired by Mr. Phillips during his career in the Agency. Whether a given sentence is in the public domain or not, Mr. Phillips should not put his stamp of authenticity on that sentence. If publish Mr. Phillips must, and if the Agency cannot legally stop him, then so be it. Hopefully, while there is still time, someone will push for appropriate legislation to stop this foolishness. : 2. While it is perhaps fruitless, we have attempted to identify some of the more damaging items in the text as drafted. These are cited below: a. Page 15: Discussion of back channel communi- Cations used to circumvent the Secretary of State seems to be ill-advised and not designed to enhance Agency relations with State. b. Page 23: There begins here a discussion of the use of women by the DDO. While I understand Mr. Phillips' desire to indicate that the DDO does in fact hire women and minorities, this section causes Some anguish. At the present time, certainly in the Near East, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union, the E2 IMPDET CL BY 018307 14-0000 Yr) ‘use of women provides us an operational flexibility which we would not otherwise have. It is quite evident, furthermore, that the local security services have not focused on the extent to which we do use women. We would like to keep it that way as long as we possibly can, and it is the undersigned's firm belief that statements from Mr. Phillips, obviously authentic, will rather quickly bring the women we do use under increased scrutiny of hostile intelligence services. Further, in opening the Pandora's box of the use of women and minorities in the DDO, Mr. Phillips may be opening both himself and the DDO to unjustified. criticism that we are either exploiting women or not hiring enough of them; similarly the minorities. c. Page 25: I have known personally for 17 years the girl who, although stripped naked by burglars, managed to save her mother and father from harm. There are others elsewhere in the government and probably -outside who are knowledgeable about the incident. The girl, now a lovely lady, is about to be dispatched under very sensitive cover abroad. Mr. Phillips would do well to delete reference to her as being an Agency employee. d. Page 26: JI think it is unwise for Mr. Phillips to conjecture on the reason why there are few blacks employed in the DDO. His reasoning may be correct, but I would venture that not. everyone who reads his book will believe so, and the Agency may come under unfortunate pressure because of it. The specific black cited on page 27 as having removed a flag from the hands of demonstrators is a personal friend of mine. He is under cover. By citing the incident, Mr. Phillips removes that cover, for the black re- trieved the flag as an American citizen, not as a CIA officer. In sum, I would suggest the deletion of the section involving women and minorities because it opens a Pandora's box and because, as written, the cover of two highly effective officers is placed in jeopardy. e.

According to the CS file on WER BELL, three former Agency employees were contacted in 1974 by WER BELL and other representatives of a group called "Friends of Abaco (FOA), a group allegedly advocating the secession of the island of Abaco from the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The three former employees contacted are: a. John Patrick Muldoon, retired from CIA on 20 March 1972. fo) . Gheodore John Roussos), retired from CIA oF (on 31 July 1970.)

Mr. Muldoon told Mr. McTighe that he’ was nominal Vice President of a Washington-based firm called "Security Consultants International." He presented Mr. McTighe with a report containing the essential data he possessed concerning WER BELL and other members of FOA whom he had met on 17 and 20 May 1974 in Washington, D.C. According to Mr. Muldoon, WER BELL had hopes of establishing gaming casinos, hotel and other tourist facilities in Abaco catering to the U. S. tourist crowd. As a consequence of some run-in with Prime Minister Pindling of the Bahamas, however, WER BELL is apparently persona non grata in the Bahamas; hence his ambitions appeared to be contingent on Abacan independence. Mr. Muldoon reported that at least on two occasions WER BELL made a concerted effort to involve persons formerly affiliated with the Agency in the activities of the FOA in support of its independence. On several occasions, WER BELL introduced Mr. Muldoon and Mr®3 ousso8) as active Agency officials, implying that either the Agency or the United States Government supported the aims of the FOA. WER-BELL also proposed to Messrs. Muldoon and Qoussos) in separate conversations that they conduct a study, involving a°Visit to Abaco, to determine the feasibility of Abaco's independence in political and economic terms. The study was to include interviews with citizens of Abaco prior to an alleged "plebiscite" on independence to take place in Abaco on 28 June 1974.03 In default of the collaboration of either Muldoon or (Roussos) WER BELL hired Mr. Walter Joseph ° Mackem, a former Agency friend of both Muldoon and Roussos) According to WER BELL's file, Mackem later in 1974 contacted the Agency in an attempt. to get an official policy on the activities of the FOA. Mackem was informed that the case comes under FBI jurisdiction, that this Agency has no official involvement, and that all information we had on the matter had been made available to the FBI. He was advised at that time to report his contacts and any information he had to the FBI. a3 : 7. On 24 March 1975, Mr. Joseph P. Hayes) assigned to SE/PCH, reported that during the week of 9 March 1975, he talked with Mr. Wesley Dyckman. Mr. Dyckman is a former Agency employee employed by the Drug Enforcement Agency. According to Dyckman, former Agency employee Walter Mackem was employed in the Washington area:as a private investigator.

According’ to Dyckman, the paramilitary training supposedly was to take place in Georgia, where WER BELL is based. . ? 8. On 31 August 1974, Mr. QRousdo3 met with Mr. K. Michael Absher, who at that time was AC/E/GC, and told him that WER BELL was leaving for Athens on 31 Augus$2, to sell arms to the Greek Government. WER BELL wanted(Roussos)to be _his advisor in this venture and to go to Athensy Roussos) told WER BELL that he would check with CIA before giving Him an answer. WER BELL asked (Ro ssos) to see if the Agency was in favor of such an.arms deal or not. Mr. Absher strongly advised against Goussos told Mr. Absher that he understood and agreed not to get involved. (Roussos a3 said that WER BELL would probably cali him from Athens and “he would give WER BELL a: final negative reply. 9. On 22 July 1974, the FBI reported that WER BELL may be in possession of a one-line note from former CIA Director: William Colby stemming from a chance meeting with the Director at an OSS alumni dinner, reading something like "Good to. see you again.'"' This note was apparently used by WER BELL to suggest that he and Mr. Colby were good friends. This infor- mation was passed on to Mr. Colby on 9 August 1974. 10. According to reporting from several Stations, WER BELL and Arthur L. Smith (a cohort of WER BELL's) were in several Central American countries during August and early September 1962. Their principal activity appeared to be contacting officials of the governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador for the purpose of obtaining recognition of a de facto Cuban Government in exile called the "United Organization for the Liberation of Cuba." In discussions with Nicaraguan Government representatives, WER BELL claimed the proposed Cuban Government in exile had the support of 90 separate Cuban exile organizations and 186,000 Cuban exiles. WER BELL offered a representative of the Nicaraguan Government $100,000 to obtain that government's recognition of the Cuban Government in exile. The group claimed to have its headquarters at 1025 Connecticut Avenue, NW, in Washington, D.C. While in Guatemala, Smith claimed that the group had a man in the . Department of State in Washington, D.C., whom they pay $6,000 per year "to keep them advised." 14-0000 ‘ 7 RETURN TO CIA -7- Background Use Only 1 Bo Not Reproduce 11. In December 1965 WER BELL contacted a Miami DCD asset and told him that he and six Cuban exiles in the U. S. had organized a group, including approximately 20 Cubans inside Cuba, to perform a commando operation in Cuba during early January 1966., Their primary mission was the assassination of Fidel Castro, with the secondary mission of blowing up the generators that supply electricity to Havana, Cuba. WER BELL, at the time, stated that he was trying to get a "green light" from CIA to proceed with the mission, and inferred that the mission would be called off if such approval was not obtained. 12. On 7 February 1966 the Miami office of the FBI reported that WER BELL had been in contact with various news agencies concerning an alleged plan to assassinate Fidel Castro, and reportedly also had discussed the plan with Mr. Richard Phillips, Public Affairs Officer, Department of State, Washington, D.C. WER BELL claimed to have a group of some 500 men infiltrated into Cuba and said that they were ready for action to overthrow the regime immediately following the assassination of Castro. According to the FBI, WER BELL gave the impression that he is acquainted with many high government officials, both in the U. S. and other countries, and implied that his assassination plan had been approved by CIA. 13. According to a memorandum in WER BELL's file, on 7 February 1968, one Bruce Arman Baker telephoned an employee of this Agency and said he had been in contact with WER BELL. Mr. Baker said that WER BELL was in the weapons manufacturing business and delivered them by air throughout the world. Mr. Baker said that he understood that WER BELL does this for CIA. Mr. Baker said that he understood from WER BELL that he would have to get a CIA security clearance to fly for WER BELL. Baker said that he was afraid that his past smuggling record might keep him from getting a CIA clearance. Bo5 14. WER BELL came to the attention of the Bangkok Stat ion) in early 1969 when he went to Thailand representing himself as Vice President of Sionics, Atlanta, Georgia. He described himself as a counterinsurgency expert, had a variety of weapons to display, claimed to be a retired colonel, and introduced himself at a local nightclub as Chief of CIA in Thailand. WER BELL attempted to sell arms to the Thais and also to a variety of U. S. military elements?°(Station Bangkok) passed the gist of his reputation to key personalities in the U.

WER BELL was also the subject of two memorandum signed by Lawrence R. Houston. Mr. Houston, answering a request from Joseph J.

Essentially, these changes disguise the identity of the fabricated newspaper and remove a reference to journalists as agents; delete the word "Guatemalan" to make the entered embassy non-specific; and delete the reference to listening posts and telephone monitoring to make that paragraph refer in more general terms to our ability to cover targets without referring to the use of electronic surveillance. : E-2 IMPDET - CL BY 058473 SEGRET 14-0000 . og a? SECRET 3. We then proceeded to the 29 items which we would like to see modified but which we could not consider classified. We made this clear to Hunt and went through them one by one, discussing our concern with each. Hunt contended that most of these items.should not be considered sensitive since they had been publicized extensively; in some cases confirmed in testimony; and,in the case of other items, the principals involved were dead. However, he agreed to changes in the items referred to in paragraphs 1, 3, 17, and 32 of the CI Staff memorandum of 19 September. These involve the deletions of the names of Henry Pleasants and Frank Holcomb, both now retired under cover; a direct reference to joint operations with the British in Hong Kong against China; and the wording of his reference to CIA alias documentation used by the Watergate burglars. The language of this last item will be changed so that it no longer leaves the impression that the documentation was prepared by the Agency for this operation. 4, When we had finished, Hunt and his lawyers emphasized as they had mentioned earlier in the meeting that it might be very difficult to get the publisher to agree to changes in the unclassified items. Mr. Snyder offered to present all of the items to the publisher for change without distinguishing between the classified and unclassi- fied items. He said he would do this without implying they were all classified. I felt it necessary to turn down his offer because of the risk of the publisher being unwilling to accept that many changes with the result that we would have to go back to him on the three classified items, thus presenting a situation similar to our retraction of previously demanded deletions in the Marchetti book. I think there would be some danger of the publisher using this in his adver- tising and through reviewers for publicity purposes. 5. As we were leaving, Hunt showed me what was described as a "comfort letter.'' This was a letter written by him to the publishers on 17 May 1974 at the publisher's request which said that in his opinion nothing in the manuscript violated any agreement between himself and the CIA, nor would subject him to prosecution under the espionage laws. As the meeting was ending, Hunt expressed his hope that no publicity would be given to it and that the Agency would not issue any kind of a press release. In view of the Director's decision that we shall issue a press release, I took pains to persuade Hunt that public acknowledgment of the fact that we had reviewed his SECRET CO Ws 14-00000 eS : . r/.) ; ; georney «=O ‘manuscript would be in his interest as well as ours. He had referred more than once during the meeting to the need to avoid the appearance of "a bear hug"; in other words, collusion or cooperation between him and the Agency, leaving an inference that the book was designed to be a whitewash of CLA. In view of this, it was easy to convince Hunt that an Agency press release would be in his interest. I would note here, however, that both Mr. Rocca and I felt that Hunt and his lawyers were genuinely cooperative and that a press release which is too harsh or denigrates the book or Hunt's motives might be unfair _ and considered by him to be in bad faith. Hunt appears to retain admiration and respect for the Agency and seems convinced that nothing in his book will harm our operations or personnel. Wala erate . Wo KAY / Pesan . HN BN RRISON, IR.

On 30 October.1973 I Saw Mr. John S, Warner, Acting General Counsel, to discuss two outstanding requests from the Special . Prosecutor's office in regard to U.S. passports which had been issued to E. Howard Hunt and.a MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD on Mr. Robert Bennett's session with the U.S, Prosecutor Silbert in July 1972. {handed Mr. Warner a memorandum listing the type, number and dates of the 2 passports which Mr, Hunt was issued between 1950 and 1970. In reviewing the information in this memorandum, I mentioned Mr. Hunt's tour in Spain in the middle. 1960's and the fact that I had been instructed not to include Mr. Hunt and his activities in my inspection of the Madrid Station in 1965, Ialso mentioned to Mr. Warner that I remembered two discussions with Mr. Skip Dunn late in 1972 during which he inquired of © me whether CIA had ever issued an alias passport to Mr. Hunt. I said - that as I recalled, CIA did not initiate the issuance of a U.S, alias passport, but that Mr. Hunt did have in his possession an alias travel document. This came as a surprise to Mr. Warner, He had not been previously aware that Mr. Hunt possessed a U.S, international travel document in alias, As a result he called Mr. John Richards, Office of the IG, and | asked whether Mr. Richards was aware of this and whether Mr, Dunn's reports provided this information, After an interval, Mr. Richards . called back and told Mr. Warner that I had provided information to Mr. Dunn that Mr, Hunt had a tourist card in alias. According to Mr. Richards, Mr, Dunn’s memorandum quoted me as saying that my information came from an” Avi source." At that moment, I could not recall having made such a statement. E2 IMPDET CL BY 059770 ae) rei aye) ‘ae mo} ‘ i i t 4 ‘ NW 64937 Docid:32357551 Page 2 2. Upon my return from Mr. Warner's office, I consulted with Mr. James W. Franklin, Chief, Official Cover Branch, CCS, with whom .I had discussed Mr, Dunn's inquiry in late 1972, Lasked Mr, Franklin whether he could refresh my memory, This he did immediately. He reminded me that a newspaper article (Tab A) had appeared claiming that one of the Watergate 5 had carried a U.S. passport in the name of Edward Hamilton. This newspaper article had been seen by Mr. Robert Johnson, Deputy Director of the U.S, Passport Office, who had had the U.S. Passport Office files examined with negative results. Mr. Johnson then determined from the FBI that the document involved was not a U.S. passport in the name of Edward Hamilton but a tourist card in that name. — I then remembered that because the information came from the FBI via Mr. Johnson, I had not identified the source of my information, I_ - immediately called Mr. Warner and advised him of the foregoing. 3, Later in the afternoon of 30 October 1973 Mr. Franklin came to my office with a number of documents, They consisted of a form memorandum signed by me which was addressed to Mr. Hunt dated 29 June 1970 (Tab B), a list of names numbering from 1 through 154, representing true names (Tab C), and a second listing similarly numbered, representing aliases (Tab D), Number 63 on the true name list reads E, Howard Hunt and on the alias list, Edward Joseph Hamilton. Mr. Franklin explained «- which I had forgotten == that we had obtained from TSD this list of outstanding alias birth certificates issued by TSD in an attempt to recall--if possible-- as many of these documents, or to determine what had happened to them. (Most of these alias birth certificates were issued in connection with the © Bay of Pigs Operation.) The memorandum was never forwarded to Mr. Hunt because by June 1970, he had been retired for 3 months, This memorandum had not been included in Mr. Hunt's cover file but had been kept with the working papers pertaining to the action trying to recall as many of the outstanding alias birth certificates as possible. As a result, the repeated reviews of Mr. Hunt's cover file had not yielded the information that an alias birth certificate had been issued to him, 97 of the 154 aliases were - not previously recorded in the CCS central index and the indexing after the acquisition of the list had been overlooked. The surfacing of these documents at this time occurred because in re-discussing Mr, Hunt's possession of an international travel document in alias reminded Mr, Franklin of the 1970 CCS exercise of recouping outstanding alias birth certificates, Discussions on the same subject in December 1972 simply did not result in the same memory association. NW 64937 Docid:32357551 Page 3 NW 64937 ah j & mk 4, In the late afternoon of 30 October 1973 Mr. Franklin and Isaw Mr. Warner, reported the foregoing facts to him, showed him the documents, and agreed that we would ask Mr. Johnson to check the Passport Office files once more to confirm that no U.S. passport in the name of Edward Joseph Hamilton had ever been issued to Mr. Hunt. The result of Mr. Johnson's check is still outstanding at the time of this writing. ERICH W.
