AMCLOCK/1 arrived in New York on 19 September 1967. He had been given instructions to call a JMWAVE operational number (iden A) jnext time he was out in a friendly country in order to receive , GOWTHEE instructions. When he failed to call soon after his arrival - gf it was decided to try to establish visual contact with him at arpaste (hbg same as was done successfully in 1966, to move him to call for contact i" instructions. For that purpose D1 GERVENO_wag taken to HTBASTE on 7 21 September carrying a match folder from(iden Bwwith his alias, (iden C, and room number. The plan was to make sure AMCLOCK/1 recognized DI GERVENG, who also met him in 1966, and to pass the match folder pil to AMGDCK/1 only if this could be done securely.

AMCLOCK/1 recognized the case officer and after exchanging safety signals DI GERVENO passed the match folder to the agent while both were waiting on a crowded street corner for the red light to change, at which time AMCLOCK/1 told DI GERVENO that he hac no way to contact him and would see him after lunch. erate sae SECRET agar? “ won LY Lo . ; ; ’ . en ee Ri EE NNN = Hh ROT ETE, SIP HORE PSENE NCL . . - - . . . e Loe, : SECRET. . -Q- Operationa) Chr {e} 3. On 26 September AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1500 to 1830 i at Qdden B; AMCLOCK/1 appeared to be in good health and rested and in } high spirits. He was very glad to see LI GERVENO again and to be able to discuss things openly. He criticized bitterly the living conditions in PBRUMEN but does not seem to be affected by it or by the fact that he had to live under a regime he obviously hates. In fact, he seemed quite sure of himself and plans to return to PBRUMEN at the end of the HTBASTE session. He is scheduled to remain in New York until December 1967 but may return to PBRUMEN before then for a short visit to look after his ailing mother and his wife, who had a baby girl two weeks prior to his departure. This may have influenced AMCLOCK/1 not to think about a possible defection at this time, which came as a surprise to the case officer who expected the agent to have second thoughts about return to PBRUMEN where he is not happy. ¥ 4. AMCLOCK/1 explained that he could not make contact as instructed hecause he had destroyed the phone number and both accommodation addresses we had given him for him to report from inside PBRUMEN. He destroyed them in the toilet at the airport upon his arrival in PBRUMEN in late December 1966 after observing a number of uniformed individuals at the airport which he considered to be suspicious, although they had nothing to do with AMCLOCK/1. This may have been a convenient excuse for his failure to make contact as instructed but DI GERVENO did not press the issue. Instead he was given the operational numbers of the Beekman site and of the Base in New York (Eden BPs and told he could always call yg. ei there if he could not locate DI GE YO at (iden By He was also given eg nee the JMWAVE number for emergency contact. K/1l said he tried to 2 make contact by callin den J J>to inguire about MIDDAUGH in true name, Seg ee te ing Gee was SS told that MIDDAUGH was in Washington and was given a phone number for him to call direct. AMCLOCK/1 was planning ire oe call Washington at a later day if he had not been contacted. 5. AMCLOCK/1 reported that he has had no security problems and has not been molested inside of PBRUMEN. He was treated "royally" by the AMTHUG regime in early 1967 and everybody seemed pleased to see him back. Apparently his return surprised some individuals who pri- vately thought he would defect rather than return to PBRUMEN to live. During this time he enjoyed special privileges and received frequent invitations to official functions with foreign diplomats. However, by mid 1967 the special privileges and invitations were gradually suspended for no apparent reason. (For example, he was no longer k allowed to take his private car to a government garage for repairs and he had to arrange for themaintenance of his house, which was given to nim and kept up by the government at first). AMCLOCK/1 believes that this was due to his being under "observation" while going through a reorientation period after his long stay abroad. There is nothing to indicate that AMCLOCK/1 is not trusted or accepted by other govern- ment officials. The fact that he was sent out again. is: REP trong s E c R E T .

He hopes that in 1968 he will be asgic¢ned to another permanent post abroad. 6. In reference to his w.fe AMCLOCK/1 stated that he is now convinced that she is totally against the AMTHUG regime. After their marriage in late 1966 he was not sure of her true political ideology but during the past year he has been able to confirm her disagreement on a number of occasions. He feels confident that she would follow him in any movement against the regime, such as defection, but has not told her gbout his work for WOFACT. Gepuate LUNE Dine.

On 27 September 1967 AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1130 to 1530 for lunch.at the Beekman site. The agent was not seen entering or leaving the site and he stayed out of sight when food was brought up from the restaurant downstairs. The meeting was conducted under secure conditions and without interruptions. Only AMCLOCK/1 and DI GERVENO t t were J GERVENO were present af the Memeyee. Esce san!

Lue Kee The implication was that AMCLOCK/1 was still under observation by the AMTHUG regime and (iden _< C-actually told him to bend backwards in every way possible to prove himself while in New York. AMCLOCK/1 explained that this meant to live a model life while abroad and to perform extra work | whenever required, without complaining. AMCLOCK/1 believes that (iden “B is being trained to take over AMCLOCK/1's position as an expert TNH-économics for the AMTHUG regime. teh this is the case, this may be the last time AMCLOCK/1 is sent toUden A> Still, under much probing, AMCLOCK/1 could not come out with any Clear indication that he was suspected or was falling out of ‘grace with the AMTHUG regime. Although the agent has a tendency to emphasize his "delicate" position, the case officer believes that he is not mistrusted and still enjoys a favorable position in the government, although probably considered too bourgeois to be completely integrated with their communist philosophy. 3. Regarding the recent changes made in PBRUMEN diplomatic ¢, AMCLOCK/1 was not aware of any security shake up , the Foreign Ministry. He regarded these changes tter in accordance with their policy to bring back a reorientation tour all those diplomats stationed mree consecutive years or more. AMCLOCK/1 actually personnel abro taking place i FS CRETE = ge eos wn et ’ ae . SECRET appeared not to be aware of any major purge and not to be concerned about it. However, if this is ‘true the chances for AMCLOCK/1 to be reassigned abroad in the near future appear doubtful at this time. 4. When DI GERVENO asked AMCLOCK/1 about his work and how the recent changes may affect him, the agent then reported the following information about his position in the Foreign Ministry. After his return in late December 1966 he was given four months vacation, during which time he went by the ministry from time to time but had no job assigned to him. He used most of this time for a honeymoon and to relocate in his new home furnished by the PBRUMEN government.

At that\ time ELOCK/1 was also considered for 4 position fant gh in@den Fiwhich was thé position the PBRUMEN President wanted him to /§ OtGE High! take but AMCLOCK/1 avoided the position although it implied frequent Af a Taal ravels abroad. The reason AMCLOCK/1 gave for not taking the position wé ' ph at Gden PF was that he did not want to break away from his diplomatic, career and felt he would be better protected among his friends in the? i - Foreign Ministry.

Arrangements and Security: The meeting took place in the [ificetisatenouse) at 1400 on the above date and ended at 1500. There were no incidents of a security nature. 2. Production: Bolivian Ambassador Julio Sanjines Goytia talked on the phone to president Ovando on 20 April. Ovando said that there was pressure from the civilian members : of the cabinet on the Debray case. They related their request ‘ that Debray should be released. to a letter Ovando wrote the. - Italian novelist Alberto Moravia which they claimed stated : he would release Debray. Ovando commented to Sanjines that he had not committed himself to release Debray. The civilians oe think that the release of Debray and Bustos would take the _ pressure off the government. Ovando admitted that the govern- ment could not control the students. The Minister of Education had been destroyed when the USIS installation was damaged. Ovando commented that he would reconsider the Debray situation and commented that there were no legal precedents for Debray's release. The military will go along with it if Ovando and the cabinet will put down the union members if needed. Marcelo Quiroga still claims to be able to influence a segment of the mineworkers. Ovando'does not want to suppress by force the student demonstrations. Ovando indicated that there is a wave of uneasiness in the country. He is thinking about taking a _stronger hand in certain issues and compromise on other issues. _ 3.. Minister of Planning Jose Ortiz Mercado is coming to Washington on 2 May for a four day visit before he -.goes, to San Jose for the inauguration of Pepe Figueres. {WUSLAB/1 believes that Ortiz will be ffrank¥with him), and té1l him “what the situation is like back in La Paz. He’will attend the (ctaPtreview] of the Bolivian program. ; 4. Sanjines described the Rogelio Miranda Baldivia problem (Miranda is the Army Chief of Staff in Bolivia) as a personal matter which has now become ideological. He does not get along with General Juan Jose Torres, the Commander of the. Armed Forces. Miranda is now trying to change some commanders in field commands. 14-00000 Z 5. I. asked some clarifying questions on the OAS report of a possible demonstration against the OAS Assembly in Santo Domingo in June 1970. He said that Rolz-Bennett normally maintains contact with the OAS Deputy Secretary General Urquia, who is a close personal friend and is also a Central- American. The head of the UNDP office in Santo Domingo is Hugo Navegas. He has been asked to get the information on the possibility of such a disruption. 6. Victor Paz Estenssoro, is one of three experts picked up under an OAS contract with the University of Engineering in Lima. In actuality, Paz will receive a P-4 salary from the OAS. The project is up for board approval and will last at least a year. / 7. (wusLaB/2 went on at length on the difficulties between Miss Alexander, the former Bolivian ambassador to the OAS whose parents were murdered in La Paz, and Sanjines. In brief, Miss Alexander was accompanied to Washington by a catholic priest Father Eduardo. Sanjines offered to find him lodging in a ' Washington monastery, but he demurred. Whenever Sanjines called Miss Alexander during crises in Bolivia at early morning ee hours the father would answer the phone. He also helped with a Miss Alexander's work at the OAS and was around the Embassy office. Sanjines once found them doing some research in his files. Colonel Banzer, when assigned to Washington, said that there was an intelligence report that Father Eduardo had been involved with the guerrillas. The military finally forced the father to leave the Embassy. Miss Alexander sent him $100 on which to live. When her parents were killed he reappeared.. When Miss Alexander returned to La Paz she read a written report submitted by Sanjines on her affair with the priest, and when she came back to Washington she called up Sanjines.and told him off. 8. Sanjines said that his relations with the State Department have cooled off. He thinks that the nationaliza- tion of Gulf Oil has wedkened the government. There is a vacuum in Bolivia and this has. caused the present Bolivian government to be much more subservient to the United States than was the government of Rene Barrientos. He believes, however, that his own position with: the Bolivian government had been strengthened. Sanjines is going to San Jose for the presidential inauguration. He heard from Colonel Ayoroa ‘that Victor Paz Estenssoro as a personal friend of Figueres, had also been invited to the inauguration. Sanjines said that it would be interesting to talk to Paz. : 9. I asked WUSLAB/1/if there were any recent develop- ents between his assistant] and the Soviet Embassy. During 14-00000 -3- Bib {nis absence Mr. Peary, his assistant], received a telephone Gall from KUTAKOV, the Soviet Under-Secretary, who asked that (Peary/send directly to him Congressional reports on Chemical Warfare, USSR-US cultural exchanges, hearings on the United Nations These documents are being sent to KUTAKOV.

INTRODUCTION, In Reference E, JMWAVE forwarded a review of the nature) of its relationship with AMCARBON-2, This review indicates that the relationship with AMCARBON-2 evolved from that action which was taken in September 1962 to insure that a security preach would not occur as a result of an investigation which was being carried! out by the’Identity 1 relative to the fact that the establishment, of the Identity 2 was being kept from the YOBELT South Campus as a result of security restrictions which were in some way related to JMDUSK, While the relationship with AMCARBON-2 stemmed from the remedial action which had been taken in a crisis situation, the establishment of a working relationship with the Identity'3 was an.objective which JMWAVE had always hoped to obtain, As a matter of fact, in Reference A, the recommendation was made that JMWAVE be given approval to contact the major South Florida news media in jan attempt to work out a relationship with these news media which would insure that they did not turn the publicity spotlight on those KUBARK activities in South Florida which might come to their!attention, - Thus, when a relationship was established with AMCARBON-2, it was carefully cultivated in order that JMWAVE might be able; to use this contact at the Identity 3 as a means of aragraph 10 WAVE 8981, dated 24 September 1962 WAVE 9169, dated 28 September 1962 WAVE 9343, dated 2 October 1962 DIR 40975, dated 6 October 1962 UFGA 14417, dated 4 March 1964 mMoQw rd oveee achieving the!objective of having a relationship with the Identity 3, which would simultaneously insure the security of JMWAVE's operations and give JMWAVE an outlet into the press which could be used for surfacing cerfain select propaganda items, In the period October to “tuye \ oo (CONTINUED) Attachments: jusc (Oth du RID/AK fg A -- Five Newspaper Clippings oe B - Identifies © Se E a Jo1- THEY ve - Distr spare as w/atts NG k, ' cat TYPED .

FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR JMWAVE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH AMCARBON-1 When AMCARBON=2 introduced AMCARBON-1 to RVUTE ? ICARBON-2 reviewed the ground rules under which he had been cooperating with REUTEMAN,' This: review was conducted for AMCARBON-—1's benefit, in order that he might clearly understand the frame of reference which should prevail in his relacionships with REUTEMAN, In this review, AMCARBON-2 pointed out thai it was the policy of the Identity 3 that it would take no accion which would purposely, embarrass KUBARK or its South Florida operations, As a result, if any embarrassing items relative to KUBARK's operations in South Florida did come to the attention of the Identity 3, this material would be brought to REUTEMAN's imnediate attention, AMCARBON-2 made it clear to AMCARBON--1 that such items should be discussed with REUTEMAN in a frank manner. In addition, AMCARBON-2 made the point that, after an item was discussed, AMCARBON-1 should follow ‘REUTEMAN's guidance relative to how any particularly embarrassing item might be handled by the {dentity 3, so that it would not expose KUBARK operations and, at-the same time, would not jeopardize the journalistic reputation of the Identity 3. In addition, AMCARBON-2 pointed out that, if AMCARBON-1 brought a potentially embarzassing item to REUTEMAN's attention and remedial action on the matter was not takea by REUTEMAN within a reasonable period of time, then the Identity 3 would feel free to expose any ,ineptness on KUBARK's part. AMCARBON-Z pointed out that in return for this cooperation from the Identity 3, REUTEMAN had agreed that he would be available for contact by telephone or periodic personal meetings at which AMCARBON-1 and AMCARBON-2 could discuss broad trends and developments in Latin American affairs. AMCARBON-2 advised AMCARBON-1 that this arrangement did not mean that AMCARBON-1 could expect te obtain any classified infocmation from REUTEMAN, The point was also made that AMCARBON-L should not press for the obtaining of classified information, but he should be alert to steering tips which REUTEMAN might furnish him on fast-breaking news stories. AMCARBON-1 indicated that he understood the frame of reference which had been outlined by AMCARBON-2, This frame of reference has prevailed throughout JMWAVE's relationship with AMCARBON-1 during the period December 1962 to March 1964, 3, AMCARBON-1'S JOURNALISTIC CAREER, AMCARBON--1 originally started to work for the identity 3 in 1957 on the City Desk, and subsequently advanced from this assignment to an assignment which entailed covering major political developments in Florida, At a later date, AMCARBON-1 became a feature writer for the Identity 3.

SECRET | UFGA-14781 promotion for AMCARBON-1, and it reflected confidence in him by the Identity 3 management, AMCARBON-1 is by no means an expert on Latin America, but he is developing his knowledge on the area and, at the moment, he gives every indication of wanting to be a long-term Lavin American specialist, QDELF has been questioned about AMCARBON-1, and he has indicated that AMCARBON-1 is regarded in the journalistic trade as an extremely likeable fellow who has a keen mind but who lacks experience in depth on Latin American affairs, It is QDELF's opinion that given an appropriate lapse of time, AMCARBON-1 will develop into one of the leading Latin American specialists in U.S, journalistic circles, AMCARBON-1 has a working; command of Spanish, and he is constantly attempting to improve his language fluency. It is REUTEMAN's opinion that’ AMCARBON-1 has developed rapidly as a Latin American specialist, and he will continue to grow in this field, Thus, he is a contact who should be developed and harnessed for exploitation, bearing in mind that he does have long-term potential, 4, AMCARBON-1'S CONTACTS AND SOURCES, In keeping with the traditional pattern oF source protection which is common to newspapermen, intelligence officers and law enforcement officers, AMCARBON-1 attempts to guard the true identity of all of his sources, On the other hand, when pressed, AMCARBON-1 has identified some of his sources to REUTEMAN, in order that meaningful evaluations could be made of that information which AMCARBON-1 had passed to KUBARK, As uw result of these occasional witting identifications of his sources, and, as a result of general conversations with AMCARBON-1, REUTEMAN has learned that AMCARBON-1's sources include the following persons: { | a, Luis’ ¥FERNANDEZ Rocha (201-316766), secretary general of the .DRE, , Se .

In such instances AMCARBON-1 makes his inquiries or carries out the required action ‘ within the context of his normal journalistic activities. The use of CARBON-1 for operational support tasks enables JMWAVE to harness; the investigative facilities of the Identity 3. Several > examples of how AMCARBON-1 has been used in operationa support - tasks are outlined below: a 3° | f yi" | a. Andrew ORDONO Camps. In March 1963, Andrew *ORDONO Camps, PPOB 30 September To14, Gibara, Cuba, A 12 837 617, arrived in Miami and was given routine CAC processing. The details of this processing are contained in MIAM-00&5, dated 12 March 1963, After being released by CAC, ORDONO was interviewed by the Identity 3, and a sensational story was developed. In view of this story, JMWAVE tried to locate ORDONO for debriefing. This effort was not productivgd, thus AMCARBON-1 was asked to locate ORDONO, AMCARBON-1 did locate ORDONO jin Houston, Texas, See WAVE--6307, dated 25 March 1963, for details. bp. Discrediting Carlos BANDIN of the MRR Splinter Group. In UFGW-2555, dated 13 September 1963, Headquarters Suggested that JMWAVE might be able to discredit Carlos BANDIN Cruz (201-309611) of the |MRR splinter group as a result of BANDIN's overinflated claims relative to his faction invading Cuba, Headquarters' interest in discrediting BANDIN was also stimulated by the fact that BANDIN's irresponsible publicity stunts were causing problems for AMBIDDY-1. As a result of Headquarters’ interest in this matter, REUTEMAN had a luncheon session with AMCARBON-1 on 24 September 1963, at which AMCARBON-1 was advised that the BANDIN faction of the MRR was less than accurate in its claims relative to its activities in Cuba, In view of this, REUTEMAN suggested that the Identity 3 might want to soft peddle any future war communiques which the BANDIN faction might releases AMCARBON-1 stated that, in view of REUTENAN 's comments, the.Identity 3 would not only soft peddle, but would | ignore! the BANDIN faction in the future, Once BANDIN was discredited with AMCARBON-1, the word was ‘soon leaked by AMCARBON-1 to other newspapermen that BANDIN was not a reliable source. As a result of this action, the BANDIN group has received minimal media coverage in South Florida since September 1963. : a. OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. In the period February 1963 to February 1964 ENCARBON-I has Furnished JMWAVE with operational a 1 intelligence as outlined below: : a, in WAVE 4836, dated 21 February 1963, AMCARBON-1 reported that AMBEND-1 was pack in Miami and was the object of a great deal of press interest in view of AMBEND-1's release from a Havana prison. AMCARBON-1 a1so indicated that AMBEND-1 would probably be a knowledgeable source on the current activities of the UR in| Cuba. This operational intelligence was most helpful in terms} of keeping IJMWAVE informed on AMBEND-1's movements. Subsequent developments revealed that AMCARBON-1- could not. contact AMBEND-1, and thus AMBEND-1's return to the United States did not cause the f publicity stir that was initially anticipated. i b. In WAVE 6176, dated 22 March 1963, AMCARBON-1 reported that the Identity 3 was attempting to research a full feature article on the Bay of Pigs jnvasion, The intent of this artigqle was to furnish a recapitulation of the entire tactical situation. In this connection, ANCARBON -1 pointed out that he was ’ . ——— “PRGE NO. 4. _ eer oo CLASSIFICATION FORM 5-60 SUG UBE PREVIOUS EDITION. Ixx| (40) .

The receipt of this |operational intelligence enabled JMWAVE to brief CARLSON on the Identity 3's over-all interest in the role that. CARLSON. had played in the Bay of Pigs invasion, This briefing, in turn, enabled |CARLSON to more adequately prepare himself for a meeting with AMGARBON-1, While AMCARBON-1 did attempt to pursue this Bay of Pigs story, he never did put anything into print as the story was overtaken by other developments before AMCARBON-1 could finish his res ayeh. (P . “ c. In WAVE%QQD4, dated 9 July 1963, AMCARBON-1 advised JMWAVE that Mr. Trevor WARMBRISTER, an associate editor for the Saturday Evening Post, was in Miami during July 1963 attempting to resedrch a story regarding the possibility that strategic missiles were hidden in Cuban caves, This information enabled JMWAVE to keep Headquarters informed on sensational-type articles which might be appearing relative to Soviet missiles in Cuba, | d., In WAVE 4701, dated 20 September 1963, AMCARBON-1 gave JMWAVE his resume of the discussions which he had with AMBIDDY-1 at the Miami Playboy Club on 19 September 1963, This information was useful in obtaining an insight into what AMBIDDY-1 was telling the press, 1 e, In WAVE 5661, dated 10 October 1963, AMCARBON-1 reported on a discussion that he had had on 10 October 1963 with AMBIDDY=1's public relations man, This operational intelligence was useful in terms of keeping KUBARK advised as to what AMBIDDY-1's representatives-were telling the outside world about their operational activities. . / £, In WAVE 6910, dated 31 October 1963, AMCARBON-1 informed JMWAVE about the flood of telephone calls which were being received at the Identity 3 relative to so-called KUBARK vessels which were located in South Florida waters, This information .alerted JMWAVE to the fact that press scrutiny was going to be directed toward the Identity 5, Armed with this warn- ing, JMWAVE was able to take action which minimized the publicity repercussions from a renewed press interest in the Identity 5. In WAVE7671, dated 16 November 1963, AMCARBON-1 reported to JMWAVE the fact that he had received a letter from Peru which coatained an interesting operational lead to one Carlos MONTALVANO in Puno, Peru. This lead was examined by JMWAVE, Headquarters and the Lima Station, This examination revealed that the letter was written by a crackpot; thus, there was no real operatioaal potential in this lead, This incident did undersc the fact that AMCARBON-1 is willing to bring potentially significan operational leads to JMWAVE's attention, h. In WAVE 1614, dated 6 February 1964, AMCARBON-1 advised JMWAVE that he had received numerous telephone calls indicating that Armando Andres GUIROLA Forte, who had aefected from a Cuban fishing vessel might be an individual who had previous been seen ‘in Miami during November or December 1963. At the same time, AMNCARBON-1 pointed out that he was suspicious and thought that these telephone calls indicated that GUIROLA was rot a bona fide defector, but was either a GOC agent or a KUBARK plant, who was being used as a means of creating an incident which would embarrass the GOC, as a result of their fishing boats penetrating FORM 5-69 53a UBE PREVIOUS EDIT.ON.

PROPAGANDA OUTLET, AMCARBON-1 has been used successfully, during the period covered by this report, as a propaganda outlet through which items of interest to KUBARK could be surfaced in the free world press, Examples of how AMCARBON-1 has been harnessed in this field are outlined below: a 1 a. AMCRAB-1, The AMCRAB-1 defection story originally surfaced ir. the Miami area on 13 October 1963 via the Diario de las Americas, which played up an API release from Montevideo, The API Montevideo story highlighted AMCRAB-1's information relative tc GOC activities in Uruguay, The story in the Diario de las Americas had an extremely iimited impact on Spanish readers in the Miami area, As a result, it was decided to do a series of feature stories on AMCRAB-1, pointing up the fact that AMCRAB--1 was typical of the veterans of the Granma expedition, who felt they had been betrayed by CASTRO end had been relegated to positions of obscurity once the revolution had put CASTRO in power, AMCARBON- was briefed in detail on the AMCRAB-1 story, and he was given an opportunity to debrief AMCRAB-1 ur.der controlled conditions in a JMWAVE safehouse, After completirg his debriefing, AMCARBON-1 wrote a series of feature articles: on AMCRAB-1, The first article in the series received front page headline play. The series of articles on AMCRAB-1 were well written, and they- provided an excellent peg for JMWAVE to mount-a replay operation via other propaganda assets, AMCARBON-1's story on AMCRAB-1 was picked up by UPI, API and others, and it was played throughout Latin America, The details of this surfacing’ can be found in WAVE 5&26, dated 14 October 1963; WAVE 6092, dated 19 October 1963; and, WAVE 6174, dated 21 October 1963, b, Charles GRIFFIN Shrimp Boat Story, On 26 February 1964 JMWAVE learned that when Mr, Charles GRIFFIN’S sons went to Cuba to reclaim the hijacked shrimp boat, JOHNNY REB, they found that select items were missing from the boat when it was turned over to them, It was believed that this information would make a good human interest story which JMWAVE assets could use to counter GOC propaganda claims that United States officials had stolen items from the Cuvan fishing boats which had violated United States territorial waters, In view of this opinion, a steering tip was given to AMCARBON-1 to have the Identity 3 representative in Key West interview Mr, GRIFFIN. This interview was carried out, and an article outlining the points which were of interest to JMWAVE was published in the 27 February 1964 edition of the Identity 3. c. LAYC Story. The March 1964 LAYC meeting in Santiago, Chile, was not Yeceiving appropriate coverage in the South Florida newspapers; as a result, REUTEMAN contacted AMCARBON-1 on 5 March 1964 and suggested that the LAYC mzeting was a story which the ; Identity 3 should pursue, AMCARBON-1 was grateful for this steerin tip, and he assigned the task of preparing the story on the LAYC to one of the members of his staff, A story on the LAYC was a, subsequently published in the 6 March 1964 edition of the Identity 4.

This is attributable solely to his lack of long-standing contacts in the Latin American politica scene, |It is believed that AMCARBON-1 will ultimately overcome this shortcoming; thus, we will continue to attempt to harness him fdr the collection of positive intelligence, 9,. COMMENT, In the period covered by this report, AMCARBON-1 has been Found to be a straight-forward individual who is honest, cooperative and who understands the need for. security. Our relationship also indicates that AMCARBON-1 is an accurate reporter of that! information which he passes to KUBARK, In view of this, JMWAVE plans to continue to: harness AMCARBON-1 in the same manner that he'has been used in the past. It is believed that our rela- tionship with AMCARBON-1 enhances our ability to conduct our operational mission in a secure manner, In addition, ‘this relation-- ship tends to minimize the possibility that JMWAVE might have diffi- culties with the media outlets in the South Florida area, As a result of our continuing relationship with AMCARBON-1, a special activities report will be forwarded at appropriate intervals, 10, i It is requested that a 201 number be ussigned AMCARBON-1 and that JMWAVE be advised of the number, { . | .

They told AMFAUNA-14 that she had to come with them to identify an arrested person, AMFAUNA-14 said that eho would have to ask her supervisor for permission to leave, because it was not yet closing time. She turned to go back into the office, and the two men followed her in, The supervisor told her that it would be all right for her to go, but said that she should check-in by Phone if there were any difficulty, AMFAUNA+14's father and uncle, both of whom work in the same office, asked whether they could come with her.

He smokes both cigars and cigarettes, hia manner was soft and kindly, and AMFAUNA-14 believes -he ie probably poorly educated. He is married, but AMFAUNA-14 did not arn whether he has children or what his address is. He wears civilia /plothes and drives a black 1956 Pontiac with a grey roof. Discussing - @ man later in the AMCOG household, AHFAUNA-14 was told by Pedro TLL (whois 8 brother_of Justo CARRILLO) that Pedro knows ABAD. — ing to Pedro, ABAD is part Jewish and\an old Communist who worked half of Fidel TRO during the Batista pariod. Pedro CARRILLO thinks that ABAD may now have some regrets about the course he has taken. : Rs (b) "Carlos" aka "Samuel": AMFAUNA-14 does not know hie true nawe, He was born about 1942 or perhaps a little earlier, He is about 5'6" tall, weighs about 150 pounds, and has a muscular build, — drooping eyelids, light olive skin, wavy chestnut hair with a widows — peak. He is a nervous pacer, and walks with his head bent forward and tilted slightly to one side, An expression which he frequently used was "0.E." pronounced “OKAH" with the accent on the first syllable. He told AMFAUNA-14 that he had been a student in the Commercial School of Havana, that he had worked clandestinely under the Batista regime, had been arrested by Col, Esteban VENTURA Novo, had been released due to the influence of his father, and had gotten. out.of the country with the aid of the Mexican Ambassador to Cuba, coming then to the United States. He drives a 1959 black and white Chevrolet Corvair, wears : Givilian clothes, and carries a pistol, sometimes a .45 and sometimes a .38, AMFAUNA-14 believes him to be a 100% Communist, She thinks he ' gay have been somewhat better trained than Francisco ABAD and may have been somewhat superior in rank, although this was never clearly evident There seemed to be a little professional jealousy between the two men. IZ she told one man something which she had been unable to remember for the other, the second would show signs of jealousy or resentment. "Carlos" subsequently told AMPAUNA-14 to phone 61-4319 and ask for “Samuel” when she wanted to reach him. She phoned him at this number bout ten times in all. The phone was alwaye answered by the same woman, except for. once when a boy answered and then called for his mcther to come and take the phone, AHFAUNA-14 would ask for "Samuel" aud the woman would invariably reply that he was not there. AMFAUNA- 14 would then ask the woman to take a message for him to please call “Dolores.” The woman would always reply "Yes, Comrade."

Cooperate with the Ddz, as’ AMFAUNA-1 had briefed her to do in such a | ‘situation, « 18. - ABAD began by telling her that she was in a very serious S situation, because he knew that she had had very close connections wath a KUBARK agent. ABAD asked whether AMFAUNA-1 was identical with _ "Julio." AMPAUNA-14 caid that AMFAUNA-1 had been known as "Julio," ABAD then wanted to know whether NEGRET had been working with "Julio," AMPAUNA-14 denied this, ABAD asked whether NEGRET had known "Julio." AMPAUNA-14 denied this too, but volunteered the information that "Julio" had provided NEGRET with mail facilities, and that AMFAUNA-14 had been the cutout between them, Did NBGRET know uf "Julio's" existface, ABAD wanted to know. AMFAUKA-14 said that herda2d not , that she had brought . NBGRET mail and money which she had gotten from "Julio," and had picked wail up from him and delivered it to “Sulto," but that NEGRET had . never known "Julio's" identity. 16, The truth about AMFAUNA-14's relations with NEGRET and BRINGAS according to her statements to her KUBARK case officer in November 1963 in the JMWAVE area, is as follows: : (a) In about mid-1962, AMCOG-2 asked AMFAUNA-14 to serve as: outout’ ‘between herself and an unident 4 fied agent, and AMFAUNA-14 agreed. AMFAUNA-14 was driven to the meeting site, which was on the sidewalk in front of a textile factory near Calle 100 in Marianao, by ANCOG-2's chauffeur, a Spaniard named "Segundo," This agent introduced |. himself to ANFAUNA-i4 only as."Bl *NEGRO", and AMFAUNA-14 described . herself to him as an employee of an unidentified embassy. For contact . _ purposes, ‘“R1 Negro" gave her the telephone number 29-4800 or 40-4900, bY (b) Later, w when AMFAUNA-14 began to trust "El Negro" more, { ehe gave hin the telephone number of her mother, She learned that “MRT Kagrofa" true name waa tariea Rranlio VILLAR Negret, and that he = ‘Lived in a amall room in the rear of the textile factory, The telephon ‘Humber which he had given her was always answered by a woman whose Geme she learned to be “Waximina." (c) VILLAR Negret was born about 1928, and was about B11" tall with broad shoulders and.a strong build. He had black wavy hair. brewn eycs, an olive skin, and a face marked by acne. AMFAUNA-14 — . Bever learned anything about his family directly from him, but DSE officers told her that he was married with one child, parents lived on a farm in Pinar del Rio Province. . (4d) VILLAR Negret was a member o ucionaria |. ‘Denocratica, which AMFAUNA-14 understands to be a successor organizatiog’ to the AAA of Aureliano SANCHEZ Arango, He had formerly belonged to _ |} en action component of this organization, but more recently had de- - voted himself? to intelligence collection. AMFAUNA-14 brought hb eh sy | 1 Puctions and money from ANCOG-2, and picked up his intelligenc iad he '/veporte which she delivered to AuGoG-2, She underst that ‘ANCOG-2_ y at these reports via diplomatic channels to Fr AEZ indian Et/ Zaieg, 19 mo. 2 livered them to. an individual identified only asc! . ra x Mez," The last contact which AMFAUNA-14 had had WIth sa py ry Hegro® wae in nid September 1963 when he passed her a report which wv be said concerned le . t ia ‘Colonbia, .

AMFAUNA-14 asked her DSE interrogators whether it would not be possible to reindoctrinate “Bl Negro" instead of shoot him, but they told her that it was not worth the trouble because "El Negro" was raon of low _ morals who.

A meeting was arranged in the home of ANFAUHA-14'a mother, The female cousin, whose name was "Gladys", told AMFAUNA-14 that BRINGAS had gone into hiding and wondered whether "the family with which she worked" | (the AMCOGS) could help him get into asylum. AMFAUNA-14 said that she doubted this. "Gladys" told AMFAUNA-14 that, in case it were possible to do anything for BRINGAS, she should tclephone "Gladys" with an. ipnocent message. It was understood that @ meeting would take place at 19800 hours on the same day of the telephune call at the Ten Cent Store S3rd between 10th and 12th in Vedado. AH#AUNA-14 does not remember | Gladys telephone number which was left with her mother. (bh) In spite of what AMFAUNA-14 told the D8E, AMFAUNA-1 had: had nothing to do with NEGRET. AMFAUNA-14 had told this story to pro- tect ANCOG-2, NEGRST had known that AMCOG-2 was involved, and had once had a meeting with her in her home. Nevertheless, AMFAUNA-14 briefed ANCOG-3 on the cover story which she had told the DSE and told her that, dn case she were ever arrested and questioned, she should admit having talked to KEGRET in her home, but deny having been involved in the communications channel or knowing anything about it.

ABAD wanted to know how and when AMFAUNA-14 had first tet AMPAUHA-1. ANFAUNA-14 replied that she had met AMFAUNA-1 in about. February 1962, that AMFAUNA-1 had regularly parked hie car in a lot near her office and that they had seen each other on the street frequently, that ANFAUNA-1 hed finally spoken to her, and that a friendship had:-: developed which finally turned into a love affair. (Comment: This was a lie told to conceal the fact that it had been AMCUTLER-@ who had in-- troduced thes.) She said that AMFAUNA-1 had been her lover until about. July 1963 when she broke up with him because he was too busy with clandestine work to pay the proper amount of attention to her, 30, ABAD asked what part AMFAUNA-14 had played in AMFAUNA-l1's . clandestine activities, AMFAUNA-14 replied that AMFAUNA-1..would some- . tises telephone her late at night to invite her to go out for a ride, and she would then find that AMFAUNA-1 was going out to have agent seetings and wanted her along for cover, ABAD asked whom AMFAUNA-1 had been meeting.

(She never knew AMFAUNA-24's true name.) She also mentioned Manolo *VILLAMANAN, the true name of AMFAUNA-13 (whom she: had. known Only as AMFAUNA-1's buciness partner but when she thought she ‘could : safoly mention now that he was out of Cuba.) For good measure she added @ notional name and physical description. : : : \ 21. Referring back to AMFAUNA-1'e automobile, ABAD asked what kind of a car he had driven, AMFAUNA-14 replied that it was a gray Chevrolet Impala. She repeated that ANFAUNA-1 had formerly parked it near her office, but said that she had not ssen it recently. ABAD apked where AMFAUNA-1's red car was, and she said she did not know, He asked what the license number on this car was, and.she said she did not know. He never asked anything about the third car which AMFAUNA-1 had . obtained. ; 92. ABAD commented that the DSE had observed AMFAUNA-1 in his gutomobile in the Havana dock area on 1 January 1963, having a meeting with another person. (AMFAUNA-14 recalls that this other person was after an attempt to pick up AMFAUNA-]'s radio. $3. With reference to the KUBARK agent known as "Julio", whom they had recently identified with AMFAUNA-1, ABAD said that he knew that "Julio" had left Cuba in October 1962 and believed that he had gone to Rurope, but he said he did not know whether "Julio" had gone Clandestinely or legally. : 234. AMFAUNA-14 wae asked about AMFAUNA-1's subsources in other provinces, but she said she knew nothing about them. ABAD said he was eure that ANPAUNA-1 had a good anuree on tha Tala of Pinas. Whorne war name might be "Raul". ABAD also mentioned the name of a person who had been shot about two weeks previously and who he believed had been work- dug with AMFAUNA-1. (AMFAUNA-14 doee not remember the name of this percon. ) 25. ABAD asked if AMFAUNA-1's son had helped him in this clandes-: tine work. AMPAUNA-14. replied that the son had been with AMFAUNA-1 . freqvontly, but that she thought it was only because he was’helping — . AMWPAUNA-1 with hie buainess and that the son probably had had nothing to do with clandestine work. wee ; : apartsent, and said he could see she was not cooperating with him, She was not voluntecring information, he said, but waiting to be asked questions, ABAD said he was sure that there was much that AMFAUNA-14 could tell him spontaneously, and he intimated that there might be a- chaace for her to rehabilitate herself. weplied that they had been left in her apartment by AMFAUNA-1, who . dutended to instruct her later by SW what to do with them, She said that AMFAUNA-1 had trained her in this system, and had left her his. materials, so that he could use her as a stop-gap communications 2ine while he was trying to reorganize hie net. Crvigw a is ad ad ah <€ 38. ABAD told her that this was plainly ni ue, cause some 0 the lists were dated later than AMFAUNA-1's departure date. He said he they hed been brought to AMFAUNA-14's apartment by, AMCUTLER-2, ‘who had been observed coming there on 5 October with Loliypf*CORREOSO. (fais was true, according to AMFAUNA-14. AMCUTLER-2 and lin CORREOSO had brought the pasgenger manifests to AMFAUNA-14's house at about 1630 or 1700 hours on 5& October, and had stayed about fifteen minutes, AT the first in two weeks, initiated by AMFAUNA-39 by means of a telephone call to AMFAUNA-1's mother. who was serving as cutout between them. . AMPAUNA-38 had called the meeting to ask whether she had received any instructions from AMFAUNA-1 as to how to,act in case of an internal upriging, which a number of people in Cuba seemed to be expecting about Of AMFAUNA-24, whom ghe knew to be safely’ - AMPAUNA-24, and that he and AMFUANA-1 had rendezvoused in the dock area - 26. ABAD again turned to the envelope of papers found in AMFAUNA-14 Cm $7. ABAD asked her where the pasgenger lista came from. AMPAUNA-i4 1400 hours that samc day, AMFAUNA-14 had had a meeting with AMFAUNA-39, . (The DSE interrogators never ¢ at any: “bias ‘sentionea AMFAUNA-39, © her about this enrlier meetifg, so ANFAUNA-14 concludes that 2 4oF eae’ been under intensive surveillance that day; either AMCUTLER-2 had been . ‘under surveillance on 5 October, or she herself had been under some. kind of periodic spot check, ) 830. ABAD asked AMFAUNA-14 how she had become acquainted with ARCUTLER-3, and AHNFAUNA-14 repjied that she had met AMCUTLER-2 through AMPAUNA-15, the wife of a cousin of AMFAUNA-14 Who is a prisoner on the Iele of Pines, “90, ABAD then asked AMFAUNA-14 where her SW materiales were, which. surprised AMFAUNA-14 because she had thought they had been found during her house search and were part of the incriminating envelope which ABAD was holding. AHNFAUNA-14 told ABAD where to look for the materials, and he gent somebody to get then, 92, ABAD wanted to know how AMFAUNA-i and AMFAUNA-3 had gotten out of Cuba. AMFAUNA-14 said she did not know, She said she understood they were to get their instruction on the street once they had left her apart-| ment. 33. ABAD abruptly asked AMFAUNA- 14 wh whether she knew anybody in ‘ayano, AMFAUNA-14 said she did not, hen produced a. photograph of ANPAUNS-14 together with AMFAUNA-1 and bare 29|and told her that she : had boon in 2's home in Luyano with AMFAUNA-1 on Saturday, 7 Septe: z He asked AMFAUNA<-14!whetherlAM@EE32 were employed in an embassy, AMFAUN. 14 said whe did not know but ae she thought so.

She also concluded that the DSE. had been inefficient in not transferring their surveillance to herself: and ANPAUNA-1, ) ' * 38. ABAD again obhanged the subject suddenly, “Where is the radio?’ . ho asked. “Could AMWEE-@ have it?" AMFAUNA-14 said she did not know. anything about a radio. - "Where is the camera?" asked ABAD. AMPAUNA-14 - admitted having seen AMFAUNA-1 with a Minox camera, but said she did not krow what AMIFAUNA-1 had done with it, She said she had hoped that AMPAUHA-1 would leave it with her, and pretended to be hurt that he had pot done so. ABAD asked her whether she had ever seen one like it in ‘the A8CO0G house, and ANFAUNA-14 said that she had, Throughout the interrogation, ABAD kept reverting to the subject of the camera: and the Bhe replied that her grandmother was the cousin of AMCOG-3'! ‘mother. ABAD said that the whole family had been under observation .@ long time, and mentioned: an organization (name not remembered b “RNPAUHA-14) which ANCOG-2 had worked with during the Batista era, he wanted to know, was ANCOG-3 doing. AMFAUNA-14 said that she d think he was doing anything clandestine. ABAD replied that the DSE positive that AKCOG-3 was doing secret work. AMFAUNA-14 said tha je should not delude itself, that the entire family was too self: engage in anything of the kind. 36. ABAD. asked what the. diplomatic visitors to the AMCOG household talk about. AMVAUNA-14 said that they. “never talk On a ABAD asked *| about the attitude of"the Doctor" (AMCOG-3's uncle), and AMFAUNA-14 said : that he was waiting for the situation to settle, nt "what about “aur AuHA-37" asked ABAD.

ABAD asked whether ANFAUNA-3 had had contacts with any embassy people, for example the Spanish Embavsy. AMFAUNA--14 said that she did not know of any such contacts. . 37. "How abcut ANCUTLER-3?" askec ABAD, "Wo know that she spends (& lot of time there," AMPAUNA-14 said she did rot know, ’ 838. ABAD asked AMFAUNA-14 if she were # revolutionary, AMFAUNA-14 said that she was not, but that neither was the against the revolution. She said that she had joined the militia early in the revolution, but had soop dropped out because there were some things about the revolution which she did not understand, For instance, she could not underetand why thore should be so many shortages and rationing, whereas before the revolution there had been plenty. ABAD exp)sined that the shortages wer the result of the imperialist blockade of Cvba. AMFAUNA-14 seid that she could underatand this, but that it did mot explain why there should | be a shortage of coffee when Cuba grew its own, ABAD said that coffee was in short supply because Cuba was sending coffee to the Soviet Union in gratitude for Soviet assistance in overcoming shortages caused by the imperialist blockade. §AHFAUNA-14 replied that this was very logical now that it had been explained to her, and said she wondered why the revolutionary government did not publicly say so in order to put an end to public grumbling on the subject. 4 38, .Barly in the morning of 9 October, ABAD produced the letter ™ which AMPAUNA-14 received from AMFAUNA-1 on 7 October and held up the letter to the light, examining it carefully for traces of SW. AMFAUNA- UAto developer pilile wore brought end che wae tald ta davealan the latta which ehe did in the presence of ABAD, "Carlos, "anda third man whom ehe Was unable to get a good look at. All were very surprised and disappointed when nd secret writing appeared. They kept asking her if she were sure she was doing it right, and began intimating that she was deceiving them. (Station Comment: It is indeed surprising that no secret writing appeared, because this letter was almost undoubtedly the. one containing SW message no, 1 to AMFAUNA-14,) 40. ANFAUNA-14 also explained the use of her carbons, The only accommodation address ehe gave away was AMFAYNA-1's JMWAVE area post office box. She deliberately protected the (Rosa JUSTIZ hddress. (the home of ANPAN-2), not knowing whether this waa a real or a fictitious person, GA oY 41. "Carlos" and ABAD now invited AMFAUNA-14 to work with them, She Feplied that she might be willing to do a0, but first wanted to know what work would be expected of her, For instance, she said, she would not inform on people in her office, They told her that this would not be askedof her, because that sort of work is done by the Defense Committees. Her work, they said, would be much more important, namely maintaining a link between themselves and KUBARK. She said that would be all right, but she was afraid that it would not last long because KUBARK would probably put her on ice as soon as they learned that she had been arrested, They told her not to worry about that. 42. °"Carlos" and ABAD suggested to her that AMFAUNA-1 had briefed her to agree to cooperate with them, She denied this, claiming that she had not really wanted to work with AMFAUNA-1 at all, but had merely let herself be imposed on for old times sake, They asked whether they could trust her, She said she thought so, and asked whether she could trust them to ksep their promises, They assured her that she could, and said whe would be released the following day. : . 43. In the morning of 10 October, atter. being. to1d that she was to be released, AMPAUNA-14 was moved to a smaller cell without a bath. ‘She: sent for ABAD and complained “that he-had double-crossed her. He told 14-00000 UFGA-12894 Bune her that he was going to keep his word and release her, but that her original cell was needed for some new prisoners who were expected. He said that the DSEZ had received advance word that a boatload of refugees: were going to try to leave Cuba that night. Many of them were women, ton one of there was pregnant, so he wanted the larger cell with bath or then, 44. ABAD plways trented AMFAUNA-14 kindly and considerately, When she had 8 headache, he ordered aspirin fcr her, Hévsaw to it that she received soft drinks when she wanted them, and he seemed to be- honestly distressed whenever she wert. AKIAUNA-14 believes that it had been the DSE's intention from the very beginning to recruit her, be- eaguse she doubts that all DSE prisoners are treated as well, 48. The firet SW message which AMFAUNA-14 wrote while under DSE control was dated 10 October, the day of her release. The DSE officers asked her what her control signal. was, and she replied that it was a rubrio, but algo included her true control signal. She deliberately ausbered her first controlled SW message no. 2, to conceal the fact that she had already written several messages containing intelligence reports, — 46. In all she wrote three SW messages. under control, She was ; obliged to write each one in duplicate, one ‘of which was mailed and the other given to the DSE for study.. One day "Carlos" came to her very .-{ angrily, said he doubted that her carbons were anything more than 5 | _ ordinary paper because he had been unable to develop anything | that she | Hy ww and @hmnntadnd bane wed th mn mermavrar a hag srittcn, and threatcasd her with roarrcost. AMTAUNA-14 told hin V | that she did not know anything about it, but that if by chance he had |. tried to deveiop the letters she had written with the pills he had ‘taken-from her, it would not work, This surprised "Carlos," and -AMPAUNA-14 explained that there were two different SW systems, one for outgoing mail and the other for incoming. "Carlos" then asked her if . ' there were. any significance to the size of envelope used, or to the way: ‘the letter paper was folded, AMFAUNA-14 said she did not think so. AMFAUNA-14 feels that "Carlos" and ABAD never completely believed that . he bad an SW system, because none of the letters which she received disclosed SW when developed, and none of the letters which she wrote showed any traces of 8W when held up to glancing light. * 47, "Carlos" was the DSE officer who maintained contact with AWPAUNA-14 after her release. For two or three weeks he saw her every - day at her apartment, sometimes for only twenty minutes, and sometimes ataying for several hours, frequently late at night. Occasionally he called her at her office. Finally AMFAUNA-14 told him that she had to get up early in the morning to go to work, and asked him to visit her ‘early in the evening, which he agreed to do, At.the time of the in- ' tercepted AMGLOSSY landing in Pinar del Rio, "Carlos" did not visit “AMPAUNA-14 for five days. When he finally returned, he was dirty, aweaty and tired. He dictated an SW letter he wanted AMFAUNA-14 to -gend to KUBARK, and while she was writing it he fell asleep. - "@8, AMFAUNA-14 had to prepare written reports for him, which she :“pigned. with the pseudonym "Dolores," He told her never to call him at ‘ DSB headquarters, because he was never there. Once he brought her a book on Marxism to read, and promised to take her someday to visit a collective farm in Pinar del Rio Province, 49. Despite his occasional efforts to get her to pick up the thread of the AMFAUNA net, AMFAUNA-14 believes that the primary target she was . intended to work against. was the AMCOG household. From remarks made by both ABAD and "Carlos", she deduced that they already had an informer -in the house, but that they were not satisfied with his production, - Toward the end of her period of DSE -controlled activi jen felt that | the DSB was becoming relatively less interested in AM “net, and more in the AMCOG household. _ 80, They asked her about one Vicente LAGO, who 8 a, :at, the AMCOG house and who ‘Seems to be particularly intere!

He listened and took a few notes, but kept most of the story in his memory, He encouraged and calmed AMPAUNA-14, told her to follow DSE instructions to the letter and assured her that KUBARK would send her instructions. pati AMFAUNA-14's immediate preoccupations were AMCUTLER-2 and AMAL the (whom she knew to be blown to the DSE as KUBARK agents), . -39 (who was not yet identified but had her telephone number and might oali her at any moment with damaging results to himself), and - the possible arrival of 8Wymessages from KUBARK naming other agent - personnel, ° ‘ 53. ° On 11 October, the day after her release, AMFAUNA-14 sent a a Steers AR FH. = Barve avy: ae -— =a mommaye iv ANCUTLER-S via ARTAUNA-19 and the ascthor of Mancle VIEEAMANAS warning her that she had been arrested.

AMPAUNA-14 turned this report over to "Carlos" on 11 or 12 November, At this meeting he asked her to try to make contact with AMFAUNA-3's brother who he said had- been transferred to a hospital in Las Villas. AMFAUNA-14 said she would try, but thought it would be: . difficult, This was the last time she saw "Carlos,'"' He telephoned her again on 16 November t ask what was new, and this was their last 1 telephone contact. 72, When AMFAUNA-14 arrived at AMCOG-3's house at about 2000-hours on 15 November 1963 tor the regular Friday night supper, he took her aside and said he wanted to speak to her privately later. At about 4330 hours she went to his room. There he told her that he had received orders that she was to leave Cuba the following week. He said that precise instructions were to come on 16 and 17 November, so he made a lunch date with her for Sunday noon at his house. 73. AMFAUNA-14 was frightened by this, She did not sleep well Priday or Saturday nights, and spent Saturday in her home. 74. Sunday afternoon in AMCOG-3's house, AMCOG-3 told her that she was to leave the following day. She said that she did not want to. AMCOG-3 responded that this was an order, He said that the DSE would probably arrest her again soon, and for her own safety and that of other she must leave. He added that there were others who were to leave too, whose departure had been made conditional upon her own, : 75. AMFAUNA-14 asked whether AMCUTLER-2 were one of these other people who were to leave too, and AMCOG-3 replied that she was. 14 told him that she thought AMCUTLER-2 would not agree to leave, said that he thought she would because the orders had been couched in very strong terms, 76. He then showed her the instructions, both for herself and for AMCUTLER-2. He had her type her instructions on a piece of paper, and then memorize them, 77, Then AMCOG-3 gave AMFAUNA-14 the following verbal. messages” ‘to deliver when she reached JMWAVE: : (a) A colonel fnu LANDEIRA, a tank expert who had ‘been. in the Cuban Army under GRAU and PRIO, is a prisoner on a farm in Havana Pro= vince. He is given three days off per week to go home. His wife knows in advance when he will be coming out, AMCOG-3 does not know the wife} but has indirect contact to her, AMCOG-3 says the man is honest and ‘ intelligent and fas real soldier, and if we want him out AMCOG-3 can arrange it. . . : b) As of about 1800 hours on 17 November, a you gim . infiltrated into Cuba and had been hiding at the h ct CLASSIFICATION ae PRENSA He TORII a ee 7 . - .

(d) It is very possible that AMCUd-3 may be able to obtain and forward a copy of AMFAUNA- 14 DSE dossier. 78. On Monday morning, 18 November, AMFAUNA-14 dressed as she had been instructed, and atuffed a pair of slacks and sneakers into the straw handbag which she had been told to carry. At 1300 hours she left her office and proceeded on foot to the coiner of Atares and Arango in Reparto Luyano, arriving there at 1400 hours, Here she exceeded her instructions, waiting for AMCUTLER--2 not five minutes but fifteen, She then walked very slowly toward Calzada Luyano, hoping that AMCUTLER-2 might overtake her, This consumed another ten minutes, and by the time she reached the Calzada Luyano it was too iate for. her to walk the re- mainder of the distance, so she took a taxi. 78. AMPAUNA-14 discharged the taxi one block before theParque de la Virgen del Camino and walked the rest of the way. She went to the sbrine where she prayed for a few minutes, and then sat on a bench from which she could see the whole park. 80. At 1510 hours a 1954 Buick taxi arrived at the park. The driver stayed in the car, and two men - a colored man and a fatr-haired man - got out and walked around for about ten minutes, Finally they approached her and gave the challenge, to which she gave the correct response, One of the men then said simply "Follow me", They took her back to the taxi and put her in the back seat with one of the men, the. other two riding in front. . 81. . They headed out of the city. When the reached the Carretera de Varadero, one of the men asked her politely if she would mind keepin her eyes directed down toward the floor and not look out the window. She rode this way for about two hours, By then it was dark, and she wa told she could look up again. She took advantage of the opportunity to change into her slacks and sneakers. 82. Finally the car stopped, and she and her two escorts got out; They walked a long time. At one point, whistle signals were exchanged with someone in the darkness, and two other men appeared, one of whom: was AM@KE}2. AMPAUNA-14 and AWWEE}2 greeted each other politely, but * pretendeddnot to know each other. ot 83, They did a lot more walking and joined up with another man, wh turned out to be the radio man. He had a lot of equipment with him, and AMPAUNA-14 and AH@EE}2 helped to carry it. 84. They now reached the mangrove and began to walk through water, At one point their guide became briefly lost, but found his way again almost.-immediately, When they came to the open water, one of the guide! went forward and signalled. The boat came in in response to the signal AMPAUNA-14 »\ E}+2, and the radio man walked out Into knee-deep water and climbed into the boat, which already had a crew of two, 85. The boat proceeded out to an unidentified key, The crew con- cealed it in the mangrove, cleverly lacing and tying branches together over it to form a camouflage cover, There they went to sleep. 86. The following day, 19 November, was spent at this spot. A radio message was received during the day, At night the boat put -out for Cayo Wegano, The waves were enormous, and. AMFAUNA-14 was terribly seasick. The boat remained at the rendezvous point until 1045 hours, -” with AMPAUNA-14 pleading for the crew to return to land, saying she . would rather be shot than remain so seasick. Finally the crew did put back, saying that the ship probably would not come because thé sea was 2 = - es 4 &: ‘tallied perfectly, and the AMHICK team were well briefed on all of the - dnetructions reached her, They were taken, she said, by Lolita FORMOS " AMCUFLER-2 had visited AMFAUNA-14's apartment twice, On both occasi UFGA- 12894 -’&, ; 67. Wednesday, 20 November, was apent on the same key. A very, ° long radio message was received during the day. AMFAUNA-14 and ‘AWE, 2 both helped the radio man to decipher it, and their combined efforts took about three hours,’ Then they put out again for ‘the Cayo Megano ; rendezvous point. By this time their drinking water was all gone, | The boat was overloaded, so much of the food'and equipment was left behind on the key. Again no ship appeared. -This time, instead of | returning to their original hiding Place, the crew took the boat to Cayo: Mosquito. | i {, ; : i Here they spent the remainder of. tha'‘night, and all ct Thursday 21 November, ‘Their water was gone, there was very little focd left, | and there was only enough gasoline left for one more ‘one-way trip” out to the rendezvous point. At 1400 hours on 21 November another radio message was received With the combined efforts of the radio man, AMPAUNA-14 and AWE g| it took between two and three hours to decipher it. Everybody: Ba very optimistic; they were all sure that they would be picked up that night. 7 89. Promptly at 2300 hours. the ship was seen approaching. boat put out immediately, and 4ts passengers were taken aboard. the shi AMPAUNA-14 was taken into the sick bay where she was given a pill little water, ‘nd somewhat later some varm broth, A 90; From the moment she stepped into the ‘boat on 18 November, unt if she was hauled out by ‘the armpits on 21 November, AMFAUNA-14 riever lef the boat. Her side and legs were bruised from the pounding of the waves: against: the boat. A little blood vessel in her‘right eye was broken by a twig snapping in her face as she walked through the man- grove, This was treated by the ship's! doctor, i el. ” AMFAUNA- 14 says that the AMHICK team performed very well, The pickup in the park was. done excellently, The slight delay while they looked her over, she says, was due to the fact that the men had ex- pected another woman to be with her, and they were waiting a few minute in case the other woman should show up, The AMHICK. team said that the had also boen briefed that she would be wearing her hair in a bun, She had not been briefed accordingly, and she was wearing her hair down her back in a pony tail, This discrepancy did not cause any con- fusion, because every other item of the visual recognition signals : @2, AMFAUNA-14 was impressed by the precise timing of the team's: movements, by the fact that everybody was where he was supposed to be at the time indicated, She expressed admiration for their seamanship, and their ability to pick out one spot of mangrove from another in the pitch darkness, 93. She says that, during these trying days, the team members were alwaya in cals control of the situation, and never failing in their courtesy to her, 94. Regarding AMCUTLER--2, AMFAUNA-14 is sure that the exfiltration who had been standing by for them from Friday to Sunday. What Lolita did with them, ANFAUNA-14 does not. know, She knows that we had suggested that Lolita take them to AMFAUNA-1's mother, but she also knows that we had indicated to AMCOG-3 that AMFAUNA-1's mother might be under surveillance, so she thinks Lolita might have taken them directly to AMCUTLER-2. In any case, she knows that messages sent previously by AMCOG-3 to AMCUTLER-2 reached the latter, and she sees no reason to assume that these instructions did not. 95... It does not surprise AMFAUNA-14 that AMCUTLER-2 did not follow the.orders, ANCUTLER-2, she says, plays her own game with little con- ration for others, Between the time that AMFAUNA-1 left Cuba on J September, and the time that AMFAUNA-14 was arrested on 7 O¢tobe T, nei, SECRET‘! " urcd- 12804 AMPAUNA-14 had asked her to remove the suitcase that AMFAUNA-i had ieft behind, but on both occasions AMCUTLER-2 had found some excuse not to do so, When AMFAUNA-14 visited AMCUTLER-2 in her home in. Guanabacoa on 3 November for the purpose of coordinating their cover stories, AMCUTLER-2 did not seem very interested in coordinating stories or anything else. AMFAUNA-14 believes that AMCUTLER-2 may be working for the-Geceed=<Front-of the Second Front of the Escambray, becaus@-her 7... ‘very close friend Lolin *CORREOSO is the fiancee of.Hipolito ARRAURI fe who wes a collector for this organization. Among other reasgns possibly keeping AMCUTLER-2 in. Cuba, AMFAUN‘-14 says that AMCUTLER-2's mother is sick with cancer, and there may te something wrong between AMCUTLER- 1 and AMCUTLER-2. HE veka 48 . 96. - AMPAUNA-14 algo had her reasons for not wanting to pees Cuba. Besides the dangers of the trip, she would he leaving her mother and father in a dangerous position, because the DSE had forced her to sign a confersion implicating them. While she appears to be trying not to be overly critical of AMCUTLER-2, she has commented that AMCUTLER-2 knows far more members of the AMFAUNA net than she herself does, so that the reasons requiring the exfiltration of AMFAUNA-14 should be even more compelling for AMCUTLER-2, End of Dispatch;1992 | Toa 10073-10105) --| 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F.

SBEERIREN leaders have tried to .-.:’. help this growth along by setting up a youth section, calling a it "Young BEHSIREN.” SEERIREN's imaginative actions and . . publicity=-conscious programs have been responsibie for. its - - vecent growth, and this period of Rrowth, seens be now on 14-000 the verge of really pleking v up speed and 1 ‘momentum. _ wi of its role in the case of the four deserting mentum he a result 7 has reaped bountiful publicity, has succeeded in touching a os -delicate Japanese. public nerve of sympathy. and pacifism, open— ao ing a floadgate of support for BEHEIREN from all over Japan. ‘When this case fades from the limelight, it is still most . -likely that a fair percentage of current wave of popular © ae support for BEHEIRNEN will solid rmanent mass backing, / giving or the first tine, a a support its future activities, &. Activities and Accom Lishnente: -BEBRIREN has engaged in a number of propaganda actions, ad participated in inter- national anti-Vietnam War activities. It has tried to co- >. operate with certain front activities in Japan controlied by ‘the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to Investigate War -. Crimes in Vietnam activities, which cuiminated in the Tokyo § . ‘Court of last Atigust, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed ‘by the JCP. In spite of this, BEHEIREN has churned along at. its own pace, with a continuing series of anti-Vietnan war - actions, most of them related in some way to the American - - oe “pacifist movement. In this regard, BEHEIREN has succeeded in. | ‘cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the U.S. pacifist movements, and has effectually capitalized on this to promote its own action program.: The case of the four deserting sailors, while an-spparent lucky windfall for BEHEIREN, only .- points up the fact that BEBEIREN, through past organizational work and promotional activities, was “johnny-on-the-spot", ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take © the bali and run with it.
