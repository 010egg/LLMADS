In Reference E, JMWAVE forwarded a review of the nature of its relationship with " AMCARBON-2. Thia review indicates that the relationship with ANCARBON-2 evolved from that action which was taken in September 1962 to insure that a security breach would not occur as a result of an investigation which was being carried out by the Identity 1 relative to the fact that the establishment .of the Identity 2 was being. kept from the YOBELT South Campus as a-result of security restrictions which. were in some way,related to JMDUSK, While the relationship with AMCARDON-2 stemmed from the remedial action which had been taken in a crisis situation, the establishment of a working relationship with the Identity 3 was an objective which JMWAVE had always hoped to obtain, As a matter of fact, in Reference A, the recommendation was made that JMWAVE be given. approval to contact the major South Florida news media in an attempt to work out a relationship with these news media which would insure that they did not turn the publicity spotlight on those KUBARK activities in South Florida which might come to their attention, Thus, when a relationship was established with AMCARBON-2, it was carefully cultivated in order that JMWVAVE might be able to use this contact at the Identity 3 ag a means of achieving the objective of having a relationship with the Identity 3, which would simultaneously insure the security of JNWAVE's operations and give JMWAVE an outlet into the press which could be used for eran oS Lips Tien _ surfacing cortain selsct'propagand® {tena,.

In view of this, a apecial activities report is being submitted to cover the nature of JMWAVE's relationship with AMCARBON=-1 during the period December. 1962 to March 1964.° ‘FRAME or REFERENCE oR JUTAYE |S RELATIONSHIP WITT. AR RBON -1 reviewed the ground rules under which he had been’ cooperating with REUTEMAN,.This review was conducted for AMCARBON-1's benefit, in order that he might clearly understand the frame of reference. which’ should prevail in his relationships with REUTENAN, ‘In this review, AMCAREON-2 pointed out that it was the policy .of the Identity ‘3 that it would take no action which would purposely embarrass KUBARK or its South Florida operations. As -@ result, if any embarrassing items relative to KUBARK's operations ‘dn South Florida did.come to the attention of the Identity 3, this material would be brought to REUTEMAN's immediate attention. AMCARBON--2 made it clear to AMCARBON-1 that such items should be discussed with REUTEMAN in a frank manner, In addition, AMCARBUN-2 made the point that, after an item was discussed, AMCARBON-1 ‘. should follow REUTEMAN'’s guidance relative to how any particularly embarrassing item.might be handled by the Identity 3, so that it would not expose KUBARK operations and, at the same time » would not jeopardize the journalistic reputation of the Identity 3, _In addition, AMCARBON-2 pointed out that, if ANCAREBON-1 brought a: potentially embarrassing item to REUTEMAN's attention and remedial action on the matter was not taken, by REUTEMAN within & reasonable period of time, then the Identity 3 would feel free - to expose any ineptness on KUBARK's part, AMCARBON-2 pointed out that in return.for this cooperation from the Identity. 3, _ REUTEMAN had agreed that he would. be available for contact by telephone or periodic personal meetings at which AMCAREON-1 and AMCARBON-2 could discuss broad trends and developments in Latin American affairs, AMCARBON-2 advised AMCARBON-l1 that this arrangement did not mean that AMCARBON-1 could expect to obtain any classified information from REUTEMAN, The point was also made that AMCARBON-1 should not press for the obtaining of classified information, but he should be alert to steering tips which REUTEMAN might furnish him on fast-breaking news stories. AMCARBON-1 indicated that he understood the frame of reference which had been outlined by AMCARBON-2, This frame of reference has prevailed throughout JMWAVE's relationship with ANCAREON =] " during the period December 1962 to March "1964, | 3. AMCARBON-1'S JOURNALISTIC CARGER, AMCARBON=1 originally “started to work for the identity 3 in 1557 on the City Desk, and subsequently advanced from this assignment to an assignment '. which entailed covering major political developments in Florida. At a later date, ANCARBON-1l became a feature writer for the Identity 3, Then.in July or August 1962, ANCARBON-l was made ' the Identity 4, This assignment was considered to be a significant Gi (SIFICATION 7 FORM 8.60 53a = USE PREVIOUS EDITION. il (40) SECRET conninuzD FLLIIIN WE ss DISPATCH. * . JFGA-14781 promotion for AMCARBON-1, and it reflected confidence in him by the Identity 3 management, AMCARBON-1 is by no means an expert on Latin America, but he is developing his knowledge on the area and, at the moment, he gives every indication of wanting to be a long-term Latin American specialist. QDELF has been questioned about AMCARBON=-1, and he has indicated that AMCAREON-1 is regarded in the journalistic trade as an extremely likeable fellow who has .& keen mind but who lacks experience in depth on Latin American affairs, It is QDELF's opinion that given an appropriate lapse of time, AMCARBON-1 will develop into one of the leading Latin American specialists in U.S. journalistic circles, AMCARBON-1 has a working command of Spanish, and he is constantly attempting to improve his language fluency « It is REUTEMAN's opinion that AMCARBON-1 has developed rapidly as a Latin American specialist, and he will continue to grow in this field, Thus, he is a contact who should be developed and harnessed for exploitation, bearing in mind that he does have long-term potential, _ '4, AMCARBON-1'S CONTACTS AND SOURCES, In keeping with the traditional pattern of source protection which is common to ; newspapermen, intelligence officers and law enforcement officers, ANCARBON-1 attempts to guard the true identity of all of his ; sources, On the other hand, when pressed, AMNCARBON-1 has identified some of his sources to REUTEMAN, in order that meaningful evaluations could be made of that information which AMCARBON-1 had passed to KUBARK. As a result of these occasional witting identifications of his sources, and, as: a result of general conversations with . AMCARBON@-1, REUTEMAN has learned that AMCARBON-1's sources include the following ‘persons: ; . oy he . Lijis* #PERNANDEZ Rocha (201316766), secretary *general of the DRE. -:.-.. : b. Manolo #RAY Rivero (201-239298), chief of JURE, Cc. Carlos *JODD y Lobo (201--264141) of the defunct Havana Times, ....- , d. AMBIDDY-1 (201-267437). e.

OPERATIONAL SUPPORT. On occasion, AMCARBON-1 is used to carry out certain operational support tasks. In such instances, AMCARBON=-1 makes his inquiries or carries out the required action within the context of his normal journalistic activities. The use of ANCARBON=1 for operational support tasks enables JMWAVE to harness the investigative facilities of the Identity 3, -Several examples of how AMCARBON-1 has been used in operational support tasks are outlined below: . a a. ‘Andrew ORDONO Camps. In March 1963, Andrew *ORDONO Camps, DPOB 30 September IST4, Cibara, Cuba, A 12 837 617, arrived -in Miami and was given routine CAC processing. The details of this processing are contained in MIAM-0085, dated 12 March 1963. After being released by CAC, ORDONO was interviewed by the Identity 3, and a sensational story was developed, In. view of this story, JMVAVE tried to locate ORDONO for debriefing, This effort was not productiva, thus AMCARBON-1 was asked to locate ORDONO, AMCARBON-1 did locate one in Houston, Texas. See WAVE-6307, dated 25 March 1963, for etails. Cn . b. Discrediting Carlos BANDIN of the MRR Splinter Group. In UFGW-2555, dated 13 September 1963, Headquarters suggested that JMWAVE might be able to discredit Carlos BANDIN Cruz (201-309611) of the MRR splinter group as a result of BANDIN's overinflated claims relative to his faction invading Cuba, Headquarters' interest in discrediting BANDIN was also stimulated by the fact that BANDIN's irresponsible publicity stunts were causing problems for AMBIDDY-1, As'.a result of Headquarters’ interest in this matter, REUTEMAN had &® luncheon session with AMCARBON-1 on 24 September 1963, at which . AMCARBON-1 was advised that the BANDIN faction of the MRR was.less than accurate in.its claims relative to its activities in Cuba, In view of this, REUTEMAN suggested that the Identity 3 might want to soft peddle any future war communiques which the BANDIN faction might release. AMCARBON-1 stated that, in view of REUTEMAN's coments, the Identity 3 would not only soft peddle, but would ignore the BANDIN faction in the future. Once BANDIN was discredited with AMCARBON-1, the word was soon leaked by ANCARBON-1 to other newspapermen that BANDIN was not a reliable source, As a result ‘of this action, the BANDIN group has received minimal media coverage in South Florida since September 1963. 6. OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. In the period February 1963 intelligence as outlined below: 's @, “In WAVE 4836, dated 21 February 1963, AMCARBON-1 -- reported that AMBEND-1 was back in Miami and was the object of _& great deal of press interest in view of AMBEND-i's release from a Havana prison. '- AMCARBON-1 also indicated that AMBEND-1 would probably be a knowledgeable source on the current activities of the UR in Cuba. This operational intelligence was most helpful in terms of keeping JMWAVE informed on AMBEND-1's movements, Subsequent developments revealed that AMCARPON-1 could not contact. AMBEND-1, and thus AMBEND-1's return to the United States did not cause the publicity stir that was initially anticipated. ; b. In WAVE 6176, dated 22 March 1963, AMCARBON-1 feature article on the Bay of Pigs invasion. The intent of this , article was to furnish a recapitulation of the entire tactical situation. In this connection, AMCARBON-1 pointed ont that he was 2 13-00000 ‘thinking about exposing the role of Miami attorney Alex E, *CARLSON, missiles were hidden in Cuban caves, This information enabled , _reported'on a discussion that he had had on 10 October 1963 with ‘representatives were telling the outside world about their ‘going .to be directed toward the Identity 5. Armed with this warn- ' from.a Cuban fishing vessel might be an individual who had previousl} For’ 530" 58a (40) residing 145 Curtiss Parkway, Miami Springs, Florida, in the Bay of Pigs operation, AMCARBON-1 stated that, if -LSON were of any current interest to REUTEMAN, then the Identity 3 would soft peddle the CARLSON angle, REUTEMAN advised AMCARDON-1 that he had no interest in CARLSON but knew of him and was of. the opinion that. CARLSON was a sound and honest attorney. The receipt of this operational intelligence enabled JMWAVE to brief CARLSON on the Identity.3's over-all interest in the role that CARLSON had Played in the Bay of Pigs invasion, This briefing, in turn, enabled CARLSON to more adequately prepare himself for a meeting with AMCARGON-1, . While AMCARBON-1 did attempt to pursue this Bay of Pigs story, he never did put anything into print as the story: ms overtaken by other developments before AMCARBON-1 could finish 8 research, .... c.. In- WAVE 0904, dated 9 July 1963, AMCARBON-1 advised OMWAVE that Mx, Trevor *ARMBRISTER, an associate editor for the Saturday Evening Post, was in Miami during July 1963 attempting to research a story regarding the possibility that strategic JMWAVE to keep Headquarters informed on sensational—type articles which might be appearing relative to Soviet missiles in Cuba, “d, © In‘WAVE 4701, dated 20 September 1963, AMCARBON-1 gave JMWAVE his resume of the discussions which he had with ANBIDDY-1 ‘at..the’ Miami Playboy Club on.19 September 1963, This . information was ‘useful in obtaining an insight into what AMBIDDY-1 was telling. the press. . . "en WAVE 5661, dated 10 October 1963, AMCARBON-1 AMBIDDY-1"s public relations man, This operational intelligence was useful in terms of keeping KUBARK advised as to what AMBIDDY-1's operational activities, . : £. Im WAVE 6910, dated 31 October 1963, AMCARBON--1 informed JMWAVE about the flood of telephone calls which were being received at the Identity 3 relative to so-called KUBARK vessels which were located in South Florida waters, This information alerted JMWAVE to the fact that press scrutiny wag ing, JMWAVE-was.able to take action which minimized the publicity repercussions from a renewed press interest in the Identity 5, g. In WAVE%671, dated 16 November 1963, AMCARBON-1 reported to JMWAVE the fact that he had received a letter from Peru which contained an interesting operational lead to one ; Carlos MONTALVANO in Puno, Peru. This lead was examined by JMWVAVE, Headquarters and the Lima Station. This examination revealed that the letter was written by a crackpot; thus, there was no real. operational potential in this lead, This incident did underscore [. the fact that AMCARBON-1 is willing to bring potentially significant q operational leads to JMWAVE's attention. ; h, In WAVE 1614, dated 6 February 1964, AMCARBON-1 advised JMWAVE that he had received numerous telephone calls indicating that Armando Andres GUIROLA Forte, who had defected been seen in Minami during November or December 1963, At the same time, AMCARDON--1 pointed out that he was suspicious and thought that these telephone calls indicated that GUIROLA was not a bona fide defector, but was either a GOC agent or a KUBARK plant, who was being used as.a means of creating an incident which would embarrass the GOC, as a result of their fishing boats penetrating ° CLASSIFICATION —B-E-G-R--E_T. ; fe] CONTINUED {USE PREVIOUS EDITION, 13-00000 / . United States terracorial waters. REUTEMAN a. .ised AMCARDON-1 FORM 3-60 (40) that KUBARK had played no role in mounting a provocation operation against the GOC, At the same time, REUTEMAN pointed out that it was highly unlikely that GUIROLA was a GOC agent, As a result of this conversation, arrangements were made for JMWAVE to check out certain aspects of the GUIROLA story, At the same time, ANCARBON-] was prevailed upon not to write a story which might lead the public to speculate on whether GUIROLA was an agent or a plant in a propaganda play designed to embarrass the GOC, 7. PROPAGANDA OUTLET, AMCARBON-1 has been used successfully, during the period covered by this report, as a propaganda outlet - through which items of interest to KUBARK could be surfaced in the free world press. Examples of how AMCARBON-1 has been harnessed in this field are outlined below: . . &. AMCRAB-1, The AMCRAB-1 defection story originally surfaced in. the Miami area on 13 October 1963 via the Diario de las Americas, which played up an API release from Montevideo, The API Montevideo story highlighted AMCRAB-1's information . relative to GOC activities in Uruguay, The story in the Diario ‘de las Americas’ had an extremely limited impact on Spanish readers in the Miomi area, As a result, it was decided to do a series of feature stories on AMCRAB-1, pointing up the fact that AMCRAB-1 | was typical of the veterans of the Granma expedition, who felt they had been betrayed by CASTRO and had been relegated to positions : of obscurity :once the revolution had put CASTRO in power, AMCARBON-] was briefed in ‘detail on the AMCRAB-1 story, and he was given an -opportunity to debrief ANCRAB-1 under controlled conditions in a JMWAVE safehouse.’. After completing his debriefing, ANCARDON-1 wrote a series of feature articles on AMCRAB-1, The first article in the series received front page headline play. The series of articles on AMCRAB-1 were well written, and they provided an excellent. peg for: JMVAVE to mount a replay operation via other propaganda assets. . ANCARBON--1's story on AMCRAB-1 was picked up by UPI, API and others, and it was played throughout Latin America, The details of this surfacing can be found in WAVE 5826, dated 14 October 1963; WAVE 6092, dated 19 October 1963; and, WAVE 6174, dated 21 October 1963. : sO ’ pb, - Charles GRIFFIN Shrimp Boat. Story. On 26 February 1964 JMWAVE learned that when Mr. Charles GRIFFIN'S sons went to Cuba to reclaim-the hijacked shrimp boat, JOHNNY REB, they found that - . select items were missing from the boat when it was turned over to them, It was believed that this information would make a good human interest story which JMWAVE assets could use to counter GOC propaganda claims that United States officials had stolen items from.the Cuban fishing boats which had violated United States territorial waters, In view of this opinion, a steering tip was given to AMCARBON-1 to have the Identity 3 representative in Key Weat interview Mr, GRIFFIN. This interview was carried out, and an article outlining the points which were of interest to SMWAVE was published in the 27 February 1964 edition of the Identity 3. . : c. LAYC Story, The March 1964 LAYC meeting in Santingo, Chile, was not receivang appropriate coverage in the South Florida newspapers; as a result, REUTEMAN contacted AMCARBON-1 on 5 March 1964 and suggested that the LAYC meeting was a story which the . Identity 3 should pursue, AMCARBON-1l was grateful for this steering tip, and he assigned the task of preparing the story on the LAYC to one of the members of his staff. A story on the LAYC was subsequently published in the 6 March 1964 edition of the Identity 3 / : ; (COMMENT: Copies of the articles cited in subparagraphs a through © above are attached for Headquarters information,) 58a 0s Use PREVIOUS EDITION. 13-00000 ty 53a 8. POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE, Attempts have been made to obtain aisseminable positive Tatelligence from AMCARBON-1 during . the period covered by this report, This attempt has beon fenerally unsuccessful, in that AMCARBON-1 does not have a great number of contacts in Latin America who would give him access to worthwhile intelligence apprecinbly in advance of the information appearing in the overt press, As a result, AMCARBON-1 is usually not aware of |pf inside developments in any Latin American country; consequently, he is not a worthwhile source. of positive intelligence, Asa . matter of fact, AMCARBON-1 is less valuable as a source of positive intelligence. than most journalists, This is attributable solely to his lack of long-standing contacts in the Latin American politica] ‘scene, It is believed that AMCARBON-1 will ultimately overcome this shortcoming; thus, we will continue to attempt to harness him ter ‘ the collection of Positive intelligence, - 9, coMMmNT.: an the period covered by this report, AMNCARBON-1 has been Yound.to ‘be a straight-forward individual who is honest, cooperative, and: who understands the need for security, Our relationship also indicates that AMCARBON-1 is an accurate reporter of that information which he passes to KUBARK. In view of this, JMWAVE plans‘ to:continue to harness AMCARBON-1 in the same manner that he has been used in the past. It is believed that our rela- tionship with AMCARBON-1 enhances our ability to conduct our operational mission in a secure manner, In addition, this relation- ship tends to minimize the possibility that JMWAVE might have diffi-| culties with the media outlets in the South Florida area, As a result of our continuing relationship with AMCARBON=-1, a special activities report Will be be forwarded at appropriate intervals, 10, It. is ‘yequested that a 201 number be assigned AMCARBON-1 and that JMWAVE be advised of the number, - END OF DISPATCH USE PREVIOUS EDITION, j Ooty Sot od ee - ae ; - SUABEIFICATION Dig 3 H SYMBOL AND NUMBER j 4 CELLU ALON OF - Sep er | : . ; parate Cover Attachmest } - DISPATCH SECRET B to UFGA-14781 : ee . + qdentatiea - 1 - fhe Miami News: 2 --Ginland Training Center for\ "Qetarded Children 3 - fhe Miami Herald 4 -Qatin American Editor, 5 - The LEDA ‘DISTRIBUTION : : ' «3 » Chief, SAS / . 2.=— RE Chrono’. 7% ' |. - AMCARBON-1 201 _1 - COS Chrono - .

According to a newspaper column of "Allen and Scott" in the ’ Chicago American of 6 December 1963, on the OSWALD Case, Abram CHAYES, legal Officer of the State Department, was one of two persons in- mediately responsible for OSWATLD's being permitted to return to the United States from the Soviet Union in June 1952. The other individual i named was Iiewellyn THOMPSON, the then Ambassador to Russia. Another in said to have been involved in.the handling of OSWALD's case was Samuel WISE, Counsel of the American Embassy in Moscow. 2.

WISH was an applicant for CIA employment in early 1953 and was security approved subject to polygraph on 11 August 1953. He did not enter on duty and in September 1953 the office which had been interested in him was "no longer interested". On 13 November 1953, WISE was granted a CSA.to permit his use as a contract employee on AFACTIVE in. New York City. His CSA was cancelled on 24 March 1958. 8. WISE was named as a friend of William Orville MUNSELL, #61693-DL, auring an investigation of the latter for possible CIA employment in 1952. WISE, according to MUNSELL's landlady and social acquaintance in Washington, D.C. during the pericd of about a year which ended. in April 1952, was the only person she knew by name with whom MUNSELL was friendly. According to the informant, WISE was a student at Columbia University whose address was 423 Fornald Hall. MUNSELL was Security disapproved for CIA employment in June 1952 because of his close association on a professional and social basis, while attending Denver University from 1946 to 1951, with persons of questionable loyality. In November 1954, MUNSELL was of interest to project FIALIVE with reference to assignment to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; however, the interested office withdrew their request on him, after Security advised of the derogatory information regarding him. 9. WISE from 1951 to 1954 attended Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, New York, which was attacked by a Citizen's Group, which alleged Communist influence in the school system.

INTRODUCTION The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in- terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying subjects of 201 files from various categories of information-about them and for — producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories..Only a rela-_ tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi- zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre- spondence has accumulated. 201 SYSTEM | a. The 201 Number: a unique number, ie, 201-1234567, ; assigned to each individual in the system to serve as s identifying file number for reporting on that individual. . b.

OL codes cover intelli- gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or . suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI codes for use by components: (1) general OI codes (Attachment 4) (2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services or other specific organizations. A component may request an OI code be’ established by submitting a mem- orandum to the DDO/RMO throvgh the component Records Management Officer. A 201 personality may y be assigned two OI codes. An OI coder may be assigned when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned, or added at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

OPENING A 201 DOSSIER , ‘ a. General The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com- ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the eccasional closing of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 20] dossiers may be - opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information will be acquired and filed in such @ dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per- sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those persons for whom provisional operational. approvals and operational approvals are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on 25 SECRET 14-00000 SECRET DOHB 70-1-1 CHAPTER III, ANNEX B 15 November 1974 persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headquarters desk and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO | records systém and are to be maintained by that unit, Some desks levy require- ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings en certain categories of persons whose ‘names appear in incoming dispatches. These are. listed in Attachment 2. 201 dossiers should be opened in the following categories: . cet (1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap- proval requests. However, a file need not be ‘opened when a POA is requested for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera- "tional interest for training purposes only. (2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening. ' (3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of ‘other than ; denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel, (4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I. or more documents (seéDOL 70-20). - (6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from ISN/ ISR (opened only by IP/RMS). : , b. Requesting a@ 201 File Opening Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filing 0 out - and submitting a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main- tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign- ment of a cryptonym to a 20] personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample 201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201’s. A field station may request the opening of a 20}. file by writing 201- in the Head- . quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after’ the subject's name in the body of the-dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by placing 201- after the term “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi- bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of 201 openings throygh receipt of the field master 201 record. 26 SECRET fanaa DOHB 70-1-1 CHAPTER II, ANNEX B 15 November 1974 4.

Hagazine 1. This memorandum is furnished for information only. 2. Haxrly in April 1968 the Office of the General Coun-: Sel made available to Central Cover StafZ (CCS) a copy of a letter and an attached list of organizations sent to the internal Revenue Service (IRS) by Hr. Jon Frappier of Ram- parts Hagaztne. The letter, dated 5 April 1968, had been furnished CGC through INS lisison channels. The letter appended a list of 145 tax-exempt organizations and indicated that all were suspected of having been funded by or having cooperated : with CIA. | 3. The letter indicated that the Listed organizati Lons were only a part of the organizations being scrutinized by Ramparts and that other available sources of information on these and other suspect organizations had already been examined. The other gources of information were stated as including the literature of the organizations and interviews with their staff members; records available in the Attorney General's offices | ino Yllinois, Massachusetts, and New York; data available at the National Inforuation Bureau in New York, Group Research, Inc., in Washington, D.C., and the Foundation Library Centers in New York and Washington; and the $90-A returns available at the district offices of the IRS. The letter requested 990-A va 03979 14-00000 cul Bs returns for specified years and in most cases the Form 1023 Application for Tax Exempt Status. Ramparts asked the IRS to make these materials available for inspection at a mutu- ally convenient tine. ee ° 4. & veview of available CIA data on the listed. organi- zations has shown that 89 of them were at one time or another somehow associated with CIA. Only two of these: are of current operational interest. These two activities aad 45 organizations formerly of? interest to CIA were men- tioned in the American press during MUDoWE.o| Forty-two other Listed organizations which were in fact associated with CIA were not exposed during(HHDOVEL.O! We have found no evidence that 55 organizations onthe list were ever directly or indirectly associated with CIA. (Because two of the names — on the list are successive names for the same organization, the actual total number of organizations listed is 144 rather than 145.) Three additional project organizations, not included in tbe Ramparts list, may be vulnerable because they were covertly Zunded by hithexto unexposed foundation funding instruments included in the list. Only one of these, is of cur- rent operational interest. _§. The CA StafZ.was furnished a copy of the Raaparts letter anc List and has checked out the organizations of possible previous CA Stazz? interest. All organizations not readily identiziable with known project organizations or as cCS funding instruments have been traced with RID, with CS area divisions that might logically have had an interest in them and agaiust CCS Registry files. Through arrangements with the IRS, xepresentatives of CCS and CGC also examined available IRS data (990-A'’s and Forms 1023) on the listed organizations. This was done before the IRS documents were made available to Ramparts, in order to be sure that restricte S90—-A, Part I. data would not be furnished to Raaparts and to try to establish the reasons for. Ramparts’ interest in the organizations. Cur current findings are the results of these various file reviews. : . : 6. Attached hereto are annexes listing and discussing the several’ categories of organizations on the Ramparts list. '. Annex & deals with the two organizations on the list which are still of active operational interest. Both received wt -3- press mention during (HOWE, Annex B lists and discusses under several sub-categories the 42 organizations with which the Agency has had some direct or indirect operational ties in the past which were not cited in the press during] ME- 0/ powEL, Annex C lists the 45 organizations included in the April 1963 list which had former Agency operational ties which were subject to press allegations during (HHDO WwEY].0/ Annex D lists and briefly discusses the 55 organizations included in the Ramparts list that had no known operational connection with CI4. Annex E lists and discusses three hitherto unex- ‘posed operational activities that are not included in the - April 1968 Ramparts List but. which are vulnerable because - they were covertly funded by hitherto unexposed funding iastru- ments included in the Ramparts list.. Annex F shows: a copy of the full. April 1968 Ramparts list. 7. The 42 former project organizations listed and des- cribed at Annex B which have not previously been charged with CIA assoctation in American press coanent ‘fall into five : general. categories: co a. Foundations and ‘other organizations used | 2s witting funding conduits for covert subsidies to pro- ject organizations and other operational activities. Sixteen organizations fall into this category. Eleven of them are multipurpose legitimate foundations. waich were recuited by CCS. Four were created or recruited | for exclusive use in funding one project each and one was used for a one-time. travel grant. b.. Witting Legitimate foundations’ and organize- tions used exclusively to provide funding and status cover for singleton agents. 5ix organizations were used in this way and provided cover for seven agents. in various parts of the world. . Some of these organi- © zations also provided one-time support for. unwitting - . individuals of operational interest. ce. Proprietary or suosidy preject organisations. here are six of these: Projects a FOCLPROOH, (ETNANABLE, ScPANFisH, and (ABSTRI i°) a. Three organizations: with which there vere witting operational contacts to obtain information aud leads but which were not actively involved opera-— tionally. 14-00000 7 ea -4- _ @. Bleven unwitting organizations which received grants from project organizations for operational or eover reasons or which cooperated with project organi- zations. _ 8. Ye cannot’ gay with complete assurance thet ‘all, 55 of ‘the apparently innocent organizations on the Ramparts list in fact never had any Agency ties. Our researches have shown that RID indices axe often incomplete. We have found operational use data in CCS files on organizations with no record in RID. The same is true in other cases where infor- mation was available in CA Staff or area division files on organizations which drew a blank in RID. . It seems likely, hovever, that any undetected operational interest in the organizations was in the period of the early 1950's and of a marginal nature. 9. In reviewing available information on the listed organizations we attempted to determine whether there was a logical external basis for Ramparts’ interest in the organi- Zations or whether some form of internal Agency leak might be involved. Our. reviews and analysis show fairly coneclu- Sively that Ramparts bas been proceeding on the basis of overtly. available information, supplemented by interviews with project personnel: a. All but three of the 42 terminated but hither-. to wnexposed project organizations and 24 of the 55 or- ganizations which actually had no Agency ties are soue— how related to project organizations or funding Lastri- ments previously exposed. Some of the organizations made jlegitinate or covert grants to previously exposed organizations, others received covert or legitimate ‘grants from previously exposed funding instruments or from innecent foundations that had made legitimate grants to exposed organizations, and still others had officers who were associated with exposed CIA organi- zations. b. Thirty-one innocent organizations on the Ramparts list and three of the hitherto unexposed Organizations of former interest to the Agency have - no such known ties to exposed Agency organizations. In most of these cases, however, the names of the organizations are similar to those of exposed organ- izations or are of a nature that makes them suspect. 14-00000 , SaBMWE «¢ i -5- 19. It seems likely that Ramparts" interest in a num ber of the 42 unexposed project organizations is based on -- factora unrelated to the actual CIA dealings with them. 11. The Headquarters elements that are or were responsi-- ble for the projects and activities that could be implicated by new Ramparts allegations have been notified of the fore-- . going findings. No further action is required at this time.

The letter requested 990-A 14-00000 SENSITIVE ot SECRET -2- returns for specified years and in most cases the Form 1023 Application for Tax Exempt Status. Ramparts asked the IRS to make these materials available for inspection at a nutu- ally convenient tinue. . 4.

MEMORANDUM FOR : (M. de Vosjoll7 SUBJECT : Report on Antonio RODRIGUEZ Echasabal Antenio RODRIGUEZ Echaszabal was bora in Cuba oa 17 August 1913. He hac 'a master's degree in agriculture, professedly has no religion but ie a Mason. RODRIGUEZ is married to Edith JONES, who was born in Cuba om 10 March 1917; she is, however, of Haitian origia, being the ‘daughter of'a former Haitian Ambaesador to Belgium, aad she is a devout Episcopalian. The couple is known to have three children: a son who was ‘inst reported to be in Havana, Cuba; a daughter married to a man of German birth who waa employed in the Castro land-reform organization | ‘uatil his departure for Germany in December 1961; and a son, Aatonio RODRIGUEZ Jones, born 24 August 1943 at Havana, who was studying at the Ecole francaise Internationale in Washington, D.C. in 1961. This son has been reported to be anti-U.5. and to have requested permission of his father to go to Cuba or te another "socialist country to continue his “Antoato R UEZ Jones resided‘in: , Washingtoa, De ome with Yvonne: JONES, his” ‘eunt. and sister -of the. ‘wife of Antonio RODRIGUEZ Echazabal. - Mise JONES was bora 10 April 1910 at Antwerp, ‘Belgium; she was unmarri: and was a secretary at the Pan Americaa Health Organization. She became a U.S. citinen in 1959, Since the Castro regime has come to power, ‘Mies JONES is said to, have opoken quite opealy for Castro and againet the U.S. Government. _ RODRIGUEZ lived in Haiti for about éighteen years prior tothe =- commencement of his diplomatic career, having been barred by the Batist: government from returning to Cuba. He became a Haitian citizen and was the owner of a Port-au-Prince meat market called "Z] Oso Blanco". Wher Castro aseumed power in Cuba, RODRIGUEZ took over the Cuban Embassy in Port-au-Prince in January 1959 alter the Batista-appolated officials had fled to the Dominican Republic. Soon thereaiter he was named Ambassado: to Haiti. ee Following his appointment to the diplomatic pest, RODRIGUEZ continu: to maintaio contact with persons in opposition to President Duvalier of Hal: vitizen of Cuba ee ee te . Y { LIE de 14-00000 In late July 1959, Haiti was invaded by a small gr ap of Cubans, suppos as a prelude to an invasion of the neighboring Dominican Republic. The incursion was succesefully repelled by the Haitian Government, which publicly charged RODRIGUEZ with complicity in the raid. RODRIGUEZ the: closed the Cuban Embassy and returned to Cuba after selling hie private property in Haiti. While RODRIGUEZ was atill in Haiti, two attempts were made on his life. He-accused the Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic aad, indirectly, the Haitian Goverar:ent of complicity in those attacks. L Ta November 1959,. RODRIGUEZ went to Guatemala as Cuban Ambassadc: There, he appears to have associated freely with pro-Commuaist groups. J. March 1960, he was requested by the Guatemalan Goverament to leave the country on the ground that he was engaging in activities inimical to the best interests of Guatemala. In November 1960, RODRIGUEZ reported to Karachi,. Pakistan, as Cubs. Ambassador. His wife accompanied him there and served as his chief . secretary. During the initial months of hie tour there, hie closest relation. in the diplomatic colony were with officials of the Belgian Embassy, . presumably as a result of ithe fact. that: Belgium. had represented Cuba when /there was no. Cuban repres ative in Karachi. During 1961, however, his ‘social contacts were almos exclusively with Sovi atellite and Chinese . ‘Commualst diplomatic. pe: 60 - ee In late 1961, ‘when RODRIGUEZ apparently had decided t to defect, he confided to an acquaintance in the diplomatic colony that he was finished “with politica and wanted to devote the rest of his life to agriculture. He he: at the time to go to the Dominican Republic or to another, unspecified Sout!: American nation. At the time of his departure from Karachi by alr for Germany ia early 1962, RODRIGUEZ reportedly made only a very limited statement at the airport regarding his defection. The event apparently received very little, if any, prese notice in Pakistan. : '. Insufficient information existe at present to permit a determiaation ae : “the genuineness. of RODRIGUEZ's disaffection with the Castro regime. Fe: - rensone which have not as yet been fully.reported, the Department of State . dented a visa to RODRIGUEZ, apparently after he had made the decision tc _resiga his post in Pakistan. “We understand, howevor, that, following his eee, Non res | : : “Citizen or Guna « Soe : | Jf eee Har TE as aL ee UME 14-00000 arrival in France ia January 1962,°he received permission frem French” authorities to travel to and reside in Martinique.
