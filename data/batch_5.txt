INTRODUCTION. As a follow up to reference, Maj. Watlington arrived in Wiami on 6 June 1962. After Maj. Watlington had an op- portunity to discuss the local situation with Lt. Col. Carlos Causes + the local ACSI representative, arrangements were made for a lengthy | session on the subject of Agreed Activities. It tas agreed that | this discussion would take place at 1000 hours on 7 June 1962 at a JEWAVE safehouse facility. This meeting subsequently took place as | . geheduled and was participated in by Lt. Col. Causes, Kaj. Watlington, Dudley R. JENTONS, Charles B,.WIESINGER and Andrew K, REUTEMAN. fhe specific points which were outlined in this discussion are covered in the following paragraph. | | 2. DISCUSSIONS. in the course of the 7 June 1962, conversations with ACSI representatives the following topics worthy of recording were discussed. a. Opa Locha Refugee Referral Procedures. Way. Watlington made the point that in accordance with the agrecrents which had been reached between ACSI and KUBARX, local procedures were to be agreed upon in order that ACSI might obtain refugee referrals froa Gra Locka which could be used as a basis upon which to mount OB collection operations. Maj. Watlington under— scored the point that ACSI had no interest or charter to run other than OB collection operations. At the — : | Gane time if any of their operations produced intelli- 3 OF ‘a Gence on subject matter other than OB, this intelligence ° ‘ i on would be reported via existing ACSI reports channels, . REUTELAN indicated that JLAVAVE, acknowledged the validity of ACSI's mission in the OB field, and we were therefore f ; willing to 99 erate fully in this regard. On the other ra eg yahds ve Lies S6ved that it was essential that certain + pro.

SECRET UFGA-4322 safeguards bo built into any Opa Locka r@ferral in.order that we could minimize the possibilities for duplication “of effort and/or wire crossing. This concept was readily accopted by Maj. Watlington. It did not, however, strike a totally responsive chord in Lt. Col. Causes. This was noted but in order to proceed with preliminary arrange- nents, REUTENAN put forth the proposal that ACSI register a list of dgent requirements with Opa Locka and that this ‘list could then be used as a basis upon which refugee screenings could be conducted. It was suggested that Col. Kail would be the logical point of reference in Opa Locka } through which the referral system could be managed. In ame . *this connection it was pointed out that once Col. Kail - identified an individual whom he considered tobe pri- —- marily.of ACSI interest, he could arrange for this indi- vidual to be referred to Lt. Col. Causes' covert unit, At the same time Col. Kail would make arrangements to pass to KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and to Station JMWAVE ao copy of the Opa Locka debriefing of the individual who had been referred to ACSI. Upon receipt of this in- : formation KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and at Station JMWAVE would review the referral, If this review revealed that the individual was not of operational ars, interest to JIMWAVE and his primary access was not in fields . V7 other than OB, no objections would be expressed relative to ACSI retention and full exploitation of the body. Maj. Watlington expressed satisfaction with this proposal and “gtated that he would be prepared to discuss it further once he had an opportunity to personally review the func- tioning of the Opa Locka _center. - YL QA ect agiioi or Re use by aveTherUs.

Col. Caugos stated that he felt that he had established his equity in Ordonez through the name trace procedure. Despite this, he had found that Ordonez had disappeared from circulation; and, there- fore, he assumed that we were debriefing this man. e. Third Country Diplomats. REUTEMAN asked the ACSI representatives whether they were currently in touch with any third country diplomats. aj. Watlington stated that\ACSI had previously tried to harness thepy €apabilities of the Spanish, Uruguayan and Canadian § @iplomatic pouches./{ Coordination of these activities With KUBARK had resulted in ACSI's being denied the use of these facilities. As a result Maj. Watlington stated that at thy present time ACSI was not: in touch with any third OF Bnet, On the other hand, ACSI was interested in pursuing the third country diplomatic channel ps a means of establishing communications with inside dssets. At this point Lt. Col. Causes stated that he was very disappointed at KUBARK's refusal to allow him to use the facilities of the{Spanish, Uruguayan’2 or Canadian poucheS\] It was indicated that KUBARK under- stood I. Col. Causes' reaction; however, the KUBARK position was based on sound security principles and could not be altered. The additional explanations which were made relative to the security implications which were inherent in the use of third country diplomats and how misuse could affect long standing government to governnent or service to service agreements between ODYOKE and free world countrics did not make any impact on Lt. Gol. Causes. This gentleman was predisposed to anterpret KUBARK's refusal to allow him to use certain 2 (diplomatic pouch Phanneis as a clear indication that Sie-of KUBARK*s “primary responsibilities in the Hiani area was to restrict and inhibit ACSI operational activity. Once this attitude was identified no further attempts were made to persuade Lt. Coi. Causes that our actions had been taken in the best interests of the intelligence community. f£. Wardtime Yafiltvation of ACST fgents. A dis- cussion of those pport Gervices which KWEARK might render to ACSX operations revealed that Lt. Col. Causes was still interested in having JMWAVE infiltrate two of his agents into PRRUMEN, in this connection the poiut was made by ACSY that under optimum circumstances they would prefer that JMVAVE assume responsibility, for the agents in. the lidami area and then deliver them through a secure mechanigm to liavana. if this were not possible ACSX would reluctantly accept infiltrativa of their agents into any point in PBRUMEN. Lt. Col, Causes was told in very precise terns that JMWAVE would not undertake to infiltrate any of his agents into Havana, On the other hand, we would consider any proposal for the infiltration of selected agents to a beach area in PBRUMEN, The point was made that in this connection Lt. Col. Causes had to understand that our maritime capabilities were limited and we were currently committed to the full exploitation of ‘these assets for at least six weeks in advance. As a result any operational plan which he might submit to us should be keyed to the agsumption that approximately six to eight ‘weeks would paGs before we could realistically consider the servicing of his request. Lt. Col. Causes agreed to project his operational plans within this frame ..of reference, “iF : é. Me, : : .

A discussion of tho documentation - problem relative to agent infiltrations revoaled that at * the ponent - ACSI gid not have any.documentation problems which they’ felt warranted discussion at this session, | ’ : h. " Coordinatioa Forms. The discussion of opsra- tiopal coordination revealed that ACSI was willing for JMWAVE to coordinate locally those operational. proposals which might be received from,Lt. Col. Causes. Once this ; coordination was effected and if there were disagreoment, - then the operation could be referred to the Washington L headquarters of both ACSI and JIMWAVE, Maj. Watlington . > stated that the forms for effecting coordination in ac- cordance with procedures which had been agreed upon at a4 Washington would be sent to both JMWAVE and the ACSI unit vad in Miami in the near future. In view of this Maj. . _ Watlington suggested that we not initiate the coordination mechanism until these forms were on hand circa 1 July 1962. a rea een eee si oR RE pees me ince i. W/T Assets. The discussion of the use of W/T facilities in terms of PBRUMEN operations revealed that the Miami ACSI unit did not have any W/T assets in PBRUMEN at this time. On the other hand, Lt. Col. Causes was interested in establishing W/T assets in PBRUMEN. In : oT view of Ghis he asked if JMWAVE would continue to assess, polygraph and train those individuals that ACSI thought _ were suitable W/T candidates, It was indicated that we * iepeereret ae nt were cortainly prepared to review all appropriate cases and would render whatever support was required. This then resulted in a discussion of whether JMWVAVE would be willing to monitor ACSI W/T transmissions from PBRUMEN in those instances where the W/T operator had not been assessed, polygraphed or trainod by KUBARK. We indicated that we \ would ba glad to moniter, such transmissions if we were told in advance of the date, time and frequencies on which tho breadcasts were to be made. This then led to a dis- cussion of whether JMWAVE would be willing to transmit C/V messages for ACSY agouts. Here again, we stated that we would favorably concider any requests for C/V trans- missions providing that we knew the content of the message, the identity of the agent who was to receive it, and the « ..@gent's location and equipment which he might be using. Lt. Col. Causes stated that in view of this discussion we could anticipate that he weuld be levying requirements on us in the near future for support in the W/T field. ; t if { & ea RAE Morty jo. Seeret Writing. A discussion of 3/W teéhniques iv revealed that i¥ @ yéquest for the issuance of S/W were ie recoived from their Miami representative it would be re- viewed, and if ACSY approved the operation KUBARK would be asked to issue a system. If JMWAVE agreed via lecal coordination that the operation in question required the use of S/W, then this recommendation would bo cabled to our Washington Headquarters where coordination would be effocted with ACSI. Once this was accomplished, KUBARK Washingtgn would cable to JMWAVE the number of the system ¢ which was\to be issued. JMWAVE would then issue the system to the ACSI representative in Miami. 3. COMMENT, At the conclusi6a of the above discussion arrange- monts wore bade for lunch, but Lt. Col, Causes chose not to partici- pate in the luncheon session. During -the luncheon conversation "Haj. Watlington indicated that he did not believe that Lt. Col. . Causes would cooperate within the spirit of the DCID's. As a result he asked that JMWAVE be extremely patient with ACSI until such time - as Lt. Col. Causes retired and could be replaced. Maj. Watlington t eed o& OLBPATCH GYESEOL ARD WUMEEN UFGA-4322 CLASUIICATION = * SECRET indicated that the retivemeat was scheduled to take place at the end cf September 1962. At the end of thé luncheon session ar- rangenonts were made for JENTONS to take Maj. Watlington on a - rour of Opa Locka, Based on this tour additional discussions axe to be held with Maj, Watlington. particularly in regard to tho development of proceduiles for referral of agents to ACSI from the Opa Locka flow. 4. OPA LOCKA, Maj. Watlington and JENTONS subsequently went out to the interrogation center at Opa Locka, Here they had an interview with Col. Kail, “the tenor of which was, on the part of Maj. Watlington, to assure himself that the ACSI repre- sentative, Francasi, was having adequate access to operational leads. Col, Kail said that operational leads were shared ac- cording to their abilities between the KUBARK representative and the, ACSI man. However, there were occasional difficulties in assuring that the men best qualified received the body in question. In addition, he said KUBARK. occasionally pulled a man out of the Center without his completing the full treatment which precluded the ACSI representative's getting his hands on someone who might be well qualified for their operations, Maj. Watlington believed that assurance that the ACSI representative got a fair deal might be achieved through a more complete briefing of Col. Trudencio Ulibarri, who is in charge of the preliminary screening so that he would more fully understand what was needed. JENTONS said that this would be a very good idea, but that it would be better if it were a dual briefing with a KUBARK representative being present as well. Maj. Watlington said that he would ask his headquarters for permission to have such a briefing given. Coil, Kail expressed his opinion that the assignment of JENTONS to formal liaison with the ACSI representatives would do much to eliwinate present difficulties and all present echoed this pious thought. 5. AGREEMENT, When JENTONS turned Maj. Watlington over to Lt. Col. uses after the meeting at Opa Locka, the two ACSI representatives said that they believed that, for the time being, it would be better to continue the system as at present, pending JENTONS' permanent arrival at the beginning of July 1962. As. Lt. Col. Causes is obviously skeptical about the outcome, this was agreed to as a stopgap measure.

[Yesterday we examined all of the files ‘of correspondence between Hr. Butler and personne! of various radio- tations in 16 Latin American count ries.| tn order to build up a market for the Truth Tapes program in Latin America, Mr. Butler first obtained from the appropriate consul in New Orleans a list of the radio stations in operation in his country. He next wrote the administrative personnel of these stations about the anti-Communist purpose of INCA and offered to supply each station with Truth Tapes. Those stations requesting them were then provided with a series of the tapes. One or two years later, Mr. Sutter sent the participating station a questionnaire designed to elicit information. about audience response to the Truth Tapes program. Copies of the first questionnaire and of a revised one are attached for your information. Judging by the responses we read, the {NCA correspondence files will provide a limited amount of information; dated i304 aad 1555, an the identification of radio stations in Latin America which are broadcasting Truth Tapes, their addresses, the names of key personnel, the identification of stations not responding to the INCA offer, sizes of audiences, and their responses.
