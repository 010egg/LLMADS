With respect to the other members :.: o£ the study group, (MJ7 claims that the situation, to date, - has not been conducive to ferreting out the identities of - - these individuals, but. that she hopes that as the group continues. to meet, ‘some _Tapport will be established with her classmates. .: . . .

(M37's | first reaction tothe tour was that the cost ($699, which - * a included on the tour... __ : price includes airfare, trains, hoteis, etc.) was too high. It was explained to her that the cost factor should not » deter her from following through. It was then that (M-/7 voiced some concern that the timing of the tour may interfere with her own PCS departure (we had been talking in terms of mid-May or June 1972 up to this point). It was made clear ' to her that no fixed date has been established as yet for ‘her PCS departure and that the aforementioned tour may well prove to be.of operational interest, e.g. meeting the DRV delegation and continuing the staging process prior to her actual departure. (M7 said that she understood and would look into the matter.

These advances were necessary because of the experises had incurred in enrolling at the New School and to pay for _.. her French lessons.

One of her most outstanding features is a complete lack of interest - in anyone but her- self. When.leading. a China study class this is her method: . first she asks a question, from her notes, such as "What do you think Mao meant when he said this..." Then she clamly listens to what the class thinks Mao menat. When everyone finishes Susan begins to tell exactly what he meant to say. Through the evening her attitude remains the same "I've been here before and said this before." There, is no enthusiasm in her that Tr couid see, : ; - Susan is an expert on China. I know because she - told ome. She told everyone else too within the first eight .. Minutes of class. "Well, I spoke to those soldiers in .. _ _Yunan who fired on those peasants..." But she really didn't have to advertize her knowledge because it is very apparent. She has a solid understanding of Chinese ‘political line and_ can smoothly defend" Chinese history. ’ As ‘far as the woman herself is "concerned she has to dress in 'style.' Now, although dressing conservatively. she still developes an eye for color and she would clearly oe _ be receptive to intelligent male attention. She has a- we nice > figure and is aware of it. - ; : Perhaps the clue which best typifies Susant s personality -is her voice... It is deep, slow, even and artificially - cultured.

Zuichi. whose conspiratorial organizational skills bavé - een perhaps the most indispensible ingredients in BEHEIREN‘’s development. YOSHIKAWA was expelled from Tokyo University for his role as a ZENGAKUREN leader in the 1960 U.S./Japan™ Security Treaty riots. He then went into fulltime JCP mass movement professional work, becoming the Secretariat official’ in charge of international relations for the Japan Peace : Committee. YCSRYKAWA breke with the JCP in late 1964, . following the rupture in relations between the JCP and CPSU .dn May that year. The inspiration for BERBLIREN springs in’. ‘large measure from YOSHIKAWA's personal desire to use his organizational talents in countering the JCP and its Japan Peace Committee. YOSHIEAWA, in addition to being a2 well . ‘qualified English linguist himself, years. ago surrounded ‘himself? with a small following of similarly qualified: licutenants, whom he brought along into BEREIREN to give “him the necessary depth and experience to run this new © : YOSHIKAWA functions as BEHEIREN's Secretar - / 3.

The choice of OBA Uakoto, ex-Fulbrighter and — popular young novelist, to be the chief front man — Chair- man - Was an extremely lucky stroke for BEHEIREN. ODA has ‘taken to this grand-standing, front work like a duck to. 09°.) water. It has given him 2 chance to give unbridled vent ta: - bis own latent anti-American foelings, puffed him up to the extent that he has been dubbed “the emperor" by other BEHEIREN . activista, and given him at long last an ideological mission .— to pursue. ‘YOSHIKAWA has performed magnificently in feeding : ODA's ego needs and in infusing and indoctrinating ODA so. | that his words and actions take on sufficiently virulent. - “ anti-Anerican overtones, ODA has served another vital. 00°00") function for BENEIREN by recruiting a sizeable number of : fellow intellectuals to join the ranks of BEHEIREN activists. (Attachnent 1 is a listing of a number of those Japanese who |. have been identified as active BEHEIREN supporters or aympa- .. hizers.} \ 4. Organizational Development: In its 2 “1/2 year history, BEELIREN has not appreciably changed its organizational format, eithough it has moved its office three tines and modified its ... mame even oftener. PEHEIREN ig not a “mass organization", be-° . cause it has bad no ‘sizeable popular backing to the present -- : timc. Its hard core, secretariat organization is run by = =... YOSHIKAWA and his lieutenants. Its public image, inteliectual .. _front is led by ODA, and given body by a score of like-minded me ‘intellectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAGA, who form the loose... - _ body of BEHEIREN's activist leadership... Under this BEDEIREN ... leadership superstructure lies a paltry base of only several ‘hundred BEHEIREN “rank-and-file“::supporters, mostly young . : ‘Japanese students. Organizationaily, BEHEIREN has no ferrsl . ‘ gembership system, so its base of supporters is fluid and not)... precisely measurzble. However, the base support for BEHBIREN || hss definitely been on the upswing during 1967, and made such... * notable strides during the past summer that JCP Headquarters © officials finally feit constrained to note with concern that - _ BEBEIREN was beginning to drain off a growing number of pro- °° gregsive youth who otherwise would have been absorbed into oo the JCP's own youth movement. BEHEIREN leaders:.have tried to. . ‘help this growth along hy setting up 2 youth section, calling , at "Young BEHEIREN." BEERIREN's imaginative actions and. “ publicity-conscious programs have been responsible for its . :; .gecent growth, and this period of growth seems to be now on 14-000 the verge of » renily. picking up speed. and momentum. “Amn a result of its role in the case of the four deserting sailors, BEHEIREN °.. has reaped bountiful publicity, has succeeded in touching a delicate Japanese public nerve of sympathy and pacifism, open---: | ing a floodgate of support for BEHEIREN from all, over Japan. Ore When this case fades from the limelight, it is still most -- -.- likely that a fair percentage of current wave of popular. support fox BEHEIREN wil i rmanent mass backing, a support its future activities, - &. Activities and Accomplishnents: “ BEBEIREN has engaged in a number of propaganda actions, and. participated in inter-- national anti-Vietnam War activities. It has tried to co- --.: operate with certain front activities in Japan controlled by. the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to Investigate War Crimes in Vietnam activitiés, which culminated in the Tokyo . Court of last Atigust, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed. by the JCP. In spite of this, BEHEIREN has churned along at. its own pace, with a continuing series of anti-Vietnam war. -- actions, most of. them related in some way to the American - re pacifist movement. In this regard, BEHEIREN has succeeded in: cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the U.S...) pacifist movements, and has effectually capitalized on this to i ae promote its own action program. The case of the four aaah hea sailors, while an- apparent lucky windfall for BEHEIREN, only points up the fact that BEHSIREN, through past organizational | work and promotional activities, was “johnny-on--the-spot", _- ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take - | -the ball and run with it. BEMEIREN ran all the way in this” case and scored its most notable success since it was organized. . (Attachment 2 is a listing of BEEEINEN's more notable activities . : since its founding.

It is the first step of a three-phase, long range reorgani- zation program designed to enable the Directorate to conform to the perceptions of the Executive and the Congress as to the Directorate's role, to adjust flexibly to changing strategies and priorities, and to make most efficient use of personnel and material resources allocated to accomplish the Directorate's mission. . 2. GENERAL The Headquarters organization of the Operations Directorate is comprised of the Office of the DDO and its special staffs, the Senior Staffs, and the Area and Functional operating Divisions. (See Figure 1, attached.) 3.

DDA/Security an representatives to nee determine how he might frame his requirements to best meet. ‘our capabilities. ‘His efforts appear to be aimed at the possible CIA role with the Mafia, and a double Mafia role with Castro. He has information which implies that Trafficante was playing both sides. The IG, particularly P| Scott Breckenridge, has responsibility for the Bill Harvey association and the analysis of- the Schweiker report. Blakey has agreed that.DO will concentrate initially on the Bayo-Pawley affair and the "Soviet Defector" cover operation. Non identified informants have told him that Col. "Rep" Robertson was involved. His queries.are logical, manageable, and, if we can keep his requests to specific people or events, we should be able to respond to his requirements. (It would be, in our opinion, an - excellent idea for the ADDO to mect informally with Blakey over a luncheon. This would be useful in giving Blakey a picture of JMWAVE, but also ‘it would perhaps’ give Blakey a perspective on his.own terms of reference.
