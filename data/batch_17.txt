Christ is recommended for the Intelligence Medal of Merit in recognition of his career of especially meritorious service which has contributed significantly to the missions of CIA. - Mr. Christ joined CIA in November of 1950 as the first research and development electronics engineer in what has evolved as TSD. He created an Applied Physics Branch setting high standards for himself and the R&D engineers he recruited. His accomplishments included the anti-disturbance mine and the time pencil, both of which are still Agency stock items, and an IR beacon. As a pioneer in audio surveillance devices, he. recognized very.:early that. the use of systems concept would be most productive in meeting Agency needs. AS part of his development program, his efforts led to the establishment of specialized contract facilities such as Gaird Atomic) which in 1953 was the first Agency source of transistorized equipment. 4 In early 1957, Mr. Christ was made Chief of what is now the Audio Operations Branch of TSD and, realizing that a drastic upgrading of the caliber of field technicians was required, began aggressively re- cruiting and training graduate engineers. His high standards and efforts in this area are reflected in the fact that the majority of i TSD Audio mid-management personnel were recruited by him. In September 1960, he and two associates were apprehended while on an operation in F] continues on ATTACHED SHEET 46.

Under his early guidance, the over-the-horizon radar program developed finally into an operational system. His sensitivity to the needs of Agency operational elements based upon his experience, his technical expertise and his dedicated desire to broaden the technological capabilities of the Agency precipitated his development of a major coordinated program of accelerated R&D to provide the clandestine services with a number of new audio surveillance techniques of which the laser probe is an . example, and his conception and direction of the Microtechnology R&D program. Within this program, the success of the micro- power transistor led to the award of Medals of Merit to two scientists under his supervision. Other progeny of the micro- technology concept are three novel intelligence gathering systems to function in the air, in space, and in the sea environments, one of which is approaching operational status. Mr. Christ has also been responsible for pioneering efforts in the area of Audio Surveillance Countermeasures, first pro- posing the application of computers to the problem. Mr. Christ's imaginative leadership and inspiration to those working with him, his broad scope of interest, his resource- fulness, and philosophical devotion to the cause of the Agency and the United States have provided this Agency with an individua) whose unique efforts and accomplishments over his 20 years service are worthy of ‘this recognition.;14-00000 104-10111-10079| | | 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F.

Coleman \ ipl , C/OPS/LSN SUBJECT : FBI Investigation of Allegations Regarding CIA Activities 1. Reference is made to your memorandum, dated 30 July 1974 and captioned as above, requesting that the names of certain individuals and organizations be searched in Office of Security records and the results of such checks which may be passed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 2. The records of this Office contained no prior informa- tion identifiable with Security Defense System; Intelligence Services, Ltd.; or Advance Security Corporation. Our records reflect no prior information identifiable with Howard Gibson of Powder Springs, Georgia. 3. Mitchell Livingston Werbell III, born 8 March 1918 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, served in the Office of Strategic Services briefly from July to December 1945 during World War II,. and has repeatedly come to the attention of CIA through the intervening years thrcugh his activities, primarily in connection with the Far East ‘and Caribbean areas. He has a reputation as a "wheeler dealer, con-man, arms peddler, and soldier of fortune." 4. The foregoing information may be passed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 5. The following information from Office of Security records was recently passed to Mr. Frank Schwartz, Federal Bureau of Investigation Liaison representative: "John Patrick Muldoon - Subject was born 25 August 1937 at Washington, D. C. He entered on duty with the * Agency on 7 January 1958 as a GS-03 Courier. During his Agency career he became an Operations Officer primarily in the Far East area. His overseas assignments included (Malaysia, Bangkok, and areas of Indonesia> He went on a [3 - 24 v7) a isabilityDretirement. His retirement became effective on 19 November 1972, as a GS-12.

Gisab Without Pay status on 19 November 1971, pending z4@ 6. Office of Security records reflect that an individual, probably identical to Steve Van Cleave of Atlanta, Georgia, had falsely claimed to the State Department in January 1974 that he worked for CIA in Latin America under cover of Coca Cola Company. He also apparently indicated that he is known to FBI representatives in Buenos Aires. This information is contained in Agency cables DIR-507298, 30 January 1974, and DIR- 490860, 12 December 1973.
